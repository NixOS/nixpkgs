This report is automatically generated by the `PR / Check / cherry-pick` CI workflow.

Some of the commits in this PR require the author's and reviewer's attention.

Please follow the [backporting guidelines](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-backport-pull-requests) and cherry-pick with the `-x` flag.
This requires changes to the unstable `master` and `staging` branches first, before backporting them.

Occasionally, it is not possible to cherry-pick exactly the same patch.
This most frequently happens when resolving merge conflicts or when updating minor versions of packages which have already advanced to the next major on unstable.
If you need to merge this PR despite the warnings, please [dismiss](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/dismissing-a-pull-request-review) this review shortly before merging.
