This report is automatically generated by the `check-cherry-picks` CI workflow.

Some of the commits in this PR have not been cherry-picked exactly and require the author's and reviewer's attention.

Please make sure to follow the [backporting guidelines](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-backport-pull-requests) and cherry-pick with the `-x` flag. This requires changes to go to the unstable branches (`master` / `staging`) first, before backporting them.

Occasionally, it is not possible to cherry-pick exactly the same patch. This most frequently happens when resolving merge conflicts while cherry-picking or when updating minor versions of packages which have already advanced to the next major on unstable. If you need to merge this PR despite the warnings, please [dismiss](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/dismissing-a-pull-request-review) this review.
