# This is a distributed test of the Network Address Translation involving a topology
# with a router inbetween three separate virtual networks:
# - "external" -- i.e. the internet,
# - "internal" -- i.e. an office LAN,
#
# This test puts one server on each of those networks and its primary goal is to ensure that:
# - server (named client in the code) in internal network can reach server (named server in the code) on the external network,
# - server in external network can not reach server in internal network (skipped in some cases),
# - when using externalIP, only the specified IP is used for NAT,
# - port forwarding functionality behaves correctly
#
# The client is behind the nat (read: protected by the nat) and the server is on the external network, attempting to access services behind the NAT.
