    # which can only be switched between speaker/HDMI via a manual profile change.
    # This configures a profile set for pulseaudio which offers multiple sinks corresponding to the
    # speaker + 4 HDMI ports. This allows the user to play audio streams on the speaker and any of the 4 HDMI/USB-C
    # ports at the same time.
