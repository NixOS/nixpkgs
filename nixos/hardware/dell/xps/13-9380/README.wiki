== Firmware upgrades ==

Note that this device is supported by [https://fwupd.org/ fwupd].
To perform firmware upgrades just activate the service

<code>
services.fwupd.enable = true;
</code>

Then use <code>fwupdmgr</code> to perform updates.

== Battery drain when sleeping ==

The laptop uses the S2 sleep mode by default instead of S3, which leads to
draining a lot of battery during sleep.
