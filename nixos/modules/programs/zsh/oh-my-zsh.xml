 <title>Oh my ZSH</title>
 <para>
  <link xlink:href="https://ohmyz.sh/"><literal>oh-my-zsh</literal></link> is a
  framework to manage your <link xlink:href="https://www.zsh.org/">ZSH</link>
  configuration including completion scripts for several CLI tools or custom
  prompt themes.
 </para>
 <section xml:id="module-programs-oh-my-zsh-usage">
  <title>Basic usage</title>

  <para>
   The module uses the <literal>oh-my-zsh</literal> package with all available
   features. The initial setup using Nix expressions is fairly similar to the
   configuration format of <literal>oh-my-zsh</literal>.
<programlisting>
{
  programs.zsh.ohMyZsh = {
    enable = true;
    plugins = [ "git" "python" "man" ];
    theme = "agnoster";
  };
}
</programlisting>
   For a detailed explanation of these arguments please refer to the
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki"><literal>oh-my-zsh</literal>
   docs</link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The expression generates the needed configuration and writes it into your
   <literal>/etc/zshrc</literal>.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="module-programs-oh-my-zsh-additions">
  <title>Custom additions</title>

  <para>
   Sometimes third-party or custom scripts such as a modified theme may be
   needed. <literal>oh-my-zsh</literal> provides the
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-internals"><literal>ZSH_CUSTOM</literal></link>
   environment variable for this which points to a directory with additional
   scripts.
  </para>

  <para>
   The module can do this as well:
<programlisting>
{
  programs.zsh.ohMyZsh.custom = "~/path/to/custom/scripts";
}
</programlisting>
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="module-programs-oh-my-zsh-environments">
  <title>Custom environments</title>

  <para>
   There are several extensions for <literal>oh-my-zsh</literal> packaged in
   <literal>nixpkgs</literal>. One of them is
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/spwhitt/nix-zsh-completions">nix-zsh-completions</link>
   which bundles completion scripts and a plugin for
   <literal>oh-my-zsh</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Rather than using a single mutable path for <literal>ZSH_CUSTOM</literal>,
   it's also possible to generate this path from a list of Nix packages:
<programlisting>
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  programs.zsh.ohMyZsh.customPkgs = [
    pkgs.nix-zsh-completions
    # and even more...
  ];
}
</programlisting>
   Internally a single store path will be created using
   <literal>buildEnv</literal>. Please refer to the docs of
   <link xlink:href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#sec-building-environment"><literal>buildEnv</literal></link>
   for further reference.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis>Please keep in mind that this is not compatible with
   <literal>programs.zsh.ohMyZsh.custom</literal> as it requires an immutable
   store path while <literal>custom</literal> shall remain mutable! An
   evaluation failure will be thrown if both <literal>custom</literal> and
   <literal>customPkgs</literal> are set.</emphasis>
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="module-programs-oh-my-zsh-packaging-customizations">
  <title>Package your own customizations</title>

  <para>
   If third-party customizations (e.g. new themes) are supposed to be added to
   <literal>oh-my-zsh</literal> there are several pitfalls to keep in mind:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     To comply with the default structure of <literal>ZSH</literal> the entire
     output needs to be written to <literal>$out/share/zsh.</literal>
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Completion scripts are supposed to be stored at
     <literal>$out/share/zsh/site-functions</literal>. This directory is part
     of the
     <link xlink:href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html"><literal>fpath</literal></link>
     and the package should be compatible with pure <literal>ZSH</literal>
     setups. The module will automatically link the contents of
     <literal>site-functions</literal> to completions directory in the proper
     store path.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <literal>plugins</literal> directory needs the structure
     <literal>pluginname/pluginname.plugin.zsh</literal> as structured in the
     <link xlink:href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/91b771914bc7c43dd7c7a43b586c5de2c225ceb7/plugins">upstream
     repo.</link>
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   A derivation for <literal>oh-my-zsh</literal> may look like this:
<programlisting>
{ stdenv, fetchFromGitHub }:

stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  name = "exemplary-zsh-customization-${version}";
  version = "1.0.0";
  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    # path to the upstream repository
  };

  dontBuild = true;
  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out/share/zsh/site-functions
    cp {themes,plugins} $out/share/zsh
    cp completions $out/share/zsh/site-functions
  '';
}
</programlisting>
