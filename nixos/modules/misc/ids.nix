# This module defines the global list of uids and gids.  We keep a
# central list to prevent id collisions.

# IMPORTANT!
# We only add static uids and gids for services where it is not feasible
# to change uids/gids on service start, for example a service with a lot of
# files. Please also check if the service is applicable for systemd's
# DynamicUser option and does not need a uid/gid allocation at all.
# Systemd can also change ownership of service directories using the
# RuntimeDirectory/StateDirectory options.
