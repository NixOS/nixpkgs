    <title>General considerations on upgrades</title>

      Garage provides a cookbook documentation on how to upgrade:

    <warning>
      <para>
        Garage has two types of upgrades: patch-level upgrades and
        minor/major version upgrades.
      </para>
      <para>
        In all cases, you should read the changelog and ideally test the
        upgrade on a staging cluster.

    <warning>
      <para>
        Until 1.0 is released, patch-level upgrades are considered as
        minor version upgrades. Minor version upgrades are considered as
        major version upgrades. i.e. 0.6 to 0.7 is a major version
        upgrade.

          Garage do not provide any guarantee on moving more than one
          major-version forward. E.g., if you’re on
          <literal>0.7</literal>, you cannot upgrade to
          <literal>0.9</literal>. You need to upgrade to
          <literal>0.8</literal> first. As long as
          <link linkend="opt-system.stateVersion">stateVersion</link> is
          declared properly, this is enforced automatically. The module
          will issue a warning to remind the user to upgrade to latest
          Garage <emphasis>after</emphasis> that deploy.

    <title>Maintainer information</title>
    <para>
      As stated in the previous paragraph, we must provide a clean
      upgrade-path for Garage since it cannot move more than one major
      version forward on a single upgrade. This chapter adds some notes
      how Garage updates should be rolled out in the future. This is
      inspired from how Nextcloud does it.
    </para>
    <para>
      While patch-level updates are no problem and can be done directly
      in the package-expression (and should be backported to supported
      stable branches after that), major-releases should be added in a
      new attribute (e.g. Garage <literal>v0.8.0</literal> should be
      available in <literal>nixpkgs</literal> as
      <literal>pkgs.garage_0_8_0</literal>). To provide simple upgrade
      paths it’s generally useful to backport those as well to stable
      branches. As long as the package-default isn’t altered, this won’t
      break existing setups. After that, the versioning-warning in the
      <literal>garage</literal>-module should be updated to make sure
      that the
      <link linkend="opt-services.garage.package">package</link>-option
      selects the latest version on fresh setups.
    </para>
    <para>
      If major-releases will be abandoned by upstream, we should check
      first if those are needed in NixOS for a safe upgrade-path before
      removing those. In that case we shold keep those packages, but
      mark them as insecure in an expression like this (in
      <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/pkgs/tools/filesystem/garage/default.nix&gt;</literal>):
    </para>
    <programlisting>
/* ... */
{
  garage_0_7_3 = generic {
    version = &quot;0.7.3&quot;;
    sha256 = &quot;0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&quot;;
    eol = true;
  };
}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Ideally we should make sure that it’s possible to jump two NixOS
      versions forward: i.e. the warnings and the logic in the module
      should guard a user to upgrade from a Garage on e.g. 22.11 to a
      Garage on 23.11.
