          The explicit `replication_mode` option in `services.garage.settings`
          has been removed and is now handled by the freeform settings in order
          to allow it being completely absent (for Garage 1.x).
          That module option previously `toString`'ed the value it's configured
          with, which is now no longer possible.

          You're still using a non-string here, please manually set it to
          a string, or migrate to the separate setting keys introduced in 1.x.

          Refer to https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/documentation/working-documents/migration-1/
