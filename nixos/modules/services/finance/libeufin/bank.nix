                Exchange that is suggested to wallets when withdrawing.

                Note that, in order for withdrawals to work, your libeufin-bank
                must be able to communicate with and send money etc. to the bank
                at which the exchange used for withdrawals has its bank account.

                If you also have your own bank and taler exchange network, you
                probably want to set one of your exchange's url here instead of
                the demo exchange.

                This setting must always be set in order for the Android app to
                not crash during the withdrawal process but the exchange to be
                used can always be changed in the app.
