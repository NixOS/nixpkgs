          The Watts Up Pro contains a generic FTDI USB device without a specific
          vendor and product ID. When we probe for WUP devices, we can cause
          the user to get a perplexing "Device or resource busy" error when
          attempting to use their non-WUP device.

          The generic FTDI device is known to also be used on:

          Some laptops are broken. The lid state is either inverted, or stuck

          for users to make the laptop panel vanish, a state that might be used
