          Nix daemon process CPU scheduling policy. This policy propagates to
          build processes. `other` is the default scheduling
          policy for regular tasks. The `batch` policy is
          similar to `other`, but optimised for
          non-interactive tasks. `idle` is for extremely
          low-priority tasks that should only be run when no other task
          requires CPU time.

          Please note that while using the `idle` policy may
          greatly improve responsiveness of a system performing expensive
          builds, it may also slow down and potentially starve crucial
          configuration updates during load.

          `idle` may therefore be a sensible policy for
          systems that experience only intermittent phases of high CPU load,
          such as desktop or portable computers used interactively. Other
          systems should use the `other` or
          `batch` policy instead.

        #   to   update units -> restart
        #
        # The `stopIfChanged` setting therefore controls a trade-off between a
        # more predictable lifecycle, which runs the correct "version" of
        # the `ExecStop` line, and on the other hand the availability of
        # sockets during the switch, as the effectiveness of the stop operation
        # depends on the socket being stopped as well.
        #
        # As `nix-daemon.service` does not make use of `ExecStop`, we prefer
        # to keep the socket up and available. This is important for machines
        # that run Nix-based services, such as automated build, test, and deploy
        # services, that expect the daemon socket to be available at all times.
        #
        # Notably, the Nix client does not retry on failure to connect to the
        # daemon socket, and the in-process RemoteStore instance will disable
        # itself. This makes retries infeasible even for services that are
        # aware of the issue. Failure to connect can affect not only new client
        # processes, but also new RemoteStore instances in existing processes,
        # as well as existing RemoteStore instances that have not saturated
        # their connection pool.

        # Also note that `stopIfChanged = true` does not kill existing
        # connection handling daemons, as one might wish to happen before a
        # breaking Nix upgrade (which is rare). The daemon forks that handle
        # the individual connections split off into their own sessions, causing
        # them not to be stopped by systemd.
        # If a Nix upgrade does require all existing daemon processes to stop,
