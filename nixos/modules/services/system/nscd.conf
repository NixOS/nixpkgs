# We basically use nscd as a proxy for forwarding nss requests to appropriate
# nss modules, as we run nscd with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to the directory
# containing all such modules
# Note that we can not use `enable-cache no` As this will actually cause nscd
# to just reject the nss requests it receives, which then causes glibc to
# fallback to trying to handle the request by itself. Which won't work as glibc
# is not aware of the path in which the nss modules live.  As a workaround, we
# have `enable-cache yes` with an explicit ttl of 0
