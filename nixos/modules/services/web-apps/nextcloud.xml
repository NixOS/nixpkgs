  <title>Basic usage</title>

  <para>
   Nextcloud is a PHP-based application which requires an HTTP server
   (<literal><link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.enable">services.nextcloud</link></literal>
   optionally supports
   <literal><link linkend="opt-services.nginx.enable">services.nginx</link></literal>)
   and a database (it's recommended to use
   <literal><link linkend="opt-services.postgresql.enable">services.postgresql</link></literal>).
  </para>

  <para>
   A very basic configuration may look like this:
<programlisting>{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  services.nextcloud = {
    <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.enable">enable</link> = true;
    <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.hostName">hostName</link> = "nextcloud.tld";
    <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.nginx.enable">nginx.enable</link> = true;
    config = {
      <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbtype">dbtype</link> = "pgsql";
      <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbuser">dbuser</link> = "nextcloud";
      <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbhost">dbhost</link> = "/run/postgresql"; # nextcloud will add /.s.PGSQL.5432 by itself
      <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbname">dbname</link> = "nextcloud";
      <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.config.adminpassFile">adminpassFile</link> = "/path/to/admin-pass-file";
      <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.config.adminuser">adminuser</link> = "root";
    };
  };

  services.postgresql = {
    <link linkend="opt-services.postgresql.enable">enable</link> = true;
    <link linkend="opt-services.postgresql.ensureDatabases">ensureDatabases</link> = [ "nextcloud" ];
    <link linkend="opt-services.postgresql.ensureUsers">ensureUsers</link> = [
     { name = "nextcloud";
       ensurePermissions."DATABASE nextcloud" = "ALL PRIVILEGES";
     }
    ];
  };

  # ensure that postgres is running *before* running the setup
  systemd.services."nextcloud-setup" = {
    requires = ["postgresql.service"];
    after = ["postgresql.service"];
  };

  <link linkend="opt-networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts">networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts</link> = [ 80 443 ];
}</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   The options <literal>hostName</literal> and <literal>nginx.enable</literal>
   are used internally to configure an HTTP server using
   <literal><link xlink:href="https://php-fpm.org/">PHP-FPM</link></literal>
   and <literal>nginx</literal>. The <literal>config</literal> attribute set is
   used by the imperative installer and all values are written to an additional file
   to ensure that changes can be applied by changing the module's options.
  </para>

  <para>
   In case the application serves multiple domains (those are checked with
   <literal><link xlink:href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php">$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']</link></literal>)
   it's needed to add them to
   <literal><link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.config.extraTrustedDomains">services.nextcloud.config.extraTrustedDomains</link></literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Auto updates for Nextcloud apps can be enabled using
   <literal><link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.autoUpdateApps.enable">services.nextcloud.autoUpdateApps</link></literal>.
</para>

 <section xml:id="module-services-nextcloud-pitfalls-during-upgrade">
  <title>Pitfalls</title>

  <para>
   Unfortunately Nextcloud appears to be very stateful when it comes to
   managing its own configuration. The config file lives in the home directory
   of the <literal>nextcloud</literal> user (by default
   <literal>/var/lib/nextcloud/config/config.php</literal>) and is also used to
   track several states of the application (e.g. whether installed or not).
  </para>

  <para>
   All configuration parameters are also stored in
   <literal>/var/lib/nextcloud/config/override.config.php</literal> which is generated by
   the module and linked from the store to ensure that all values from <literal>config.php</literal>
   can be modified by the module.
   However <literal>config.php</literal> manages the application's state and shouldn't be touched
   manually because of that.
  </para>

  <warning>
   <para>Don't delete <literal>config.php</literal>! This file
   tracks the application's state and a deletion can cause unwanted
   side-effects!</para>
  </warning>

  <warning>
   <para>Don't rerun <literal>nextcloud-occ
   maintenance:install</literal>! This command tries to install the application
   and can cause unwanted side-effects!</para>
  </warning>

  <para>
   Nextcloud doesn't allow to move more than one major-version forward. If you're e.g. on
   <literal>v16</literal>, you cannot upgrade to <literal>v18</literal>, you need to upgrade to
   <literal>v17</literal> first. This is ensured automatically as long as the
   <link linkend="opt-system.stateVersion">stateVersion</link> is declared properly. In that case
   the oldest version available (one major behind the one from the previous NixOS
   release) will be selected by default and the module will generate a warning that reminds
   the user to upgrade to latest Nextcloud <emphasis>after</emphasis> that deploy.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="module-services-nextcloud-maintainer-info">
  <title>Maintainer information</title>

  <para>
   As stated in the previous paragraph, we must provide a clean upgrade-path for Nextcloud
   since it cannot move more than one major version forward on a single upgrade. This chapter
   adds some notes how Nextcloud updates should be rolled out in the future.
  </para>

  <para>
   While minor and patch-level updates are no problem and can be done directly in the
   package-expression (and should be backported to supported stable branches after that),
   major-releases should be added in a new attribute (e.g. Nextcloud <literal>v19.0.0</literal>
   should be available in <literal>nixpkgs</literal> as <literal>pkgs.nextcloud19</literal>).
   To provide simple upgrade paths it's generally useful to backport those as well to stable
   branches. As long as the package-default isn't altered, this won't break existing setups.
   After that, the versioning-warning in the <literal>nextcloud</literal>-module should be
   updated to make sure that the
   <link linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.package">package</link>-option selects the latest version
   on fresh setups.
  </para>

  <para>
   If major-releases will be abandoned by upstream, we should check first if those are needed
   in NixOS for a safe upgrade-path before removing those. In that case we shold keep those
   packages, but mark them as insecure in an expression like this (in
   <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/pkgs/servers/nextcloud/default.nix&gt;</literal>):
<programlisting>/* ... */
{
  nextcloud17 = generic {
    version = "17.0.x";
    sha256 = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
    insecure = true;
  };
}</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Ideally we should make sure that it's possible to jump two NixOS versions forward:
   i.e. the warnings and the logic in the module should guard a user to upgrade from a
   Nextcloud on e.g. 19.09 to a Nextcloud on 20.09.
