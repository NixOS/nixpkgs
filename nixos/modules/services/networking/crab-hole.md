# ðŸ¦€ crab-hole {#module-services-crab-hole}

Crab-hole is a cross platform Pi-hole clone written in Rust using [hickory-dns/trust-dns](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns).
It can be used as a network wide ad and spy blocker or run on your local PC.

For a secure and private communication, crab-hole has builtin support for DoH(HTTPS), DoQ(QUIC) and DoT(TLS) for down- and upstreams and DNSSEC for upstreams.
It also comes with privacy friendly default logging settings.

## Configuration {#module-services-crab-hole-configuration}
As an example config file using Cloudflare as DoT upstream, you can use this [crab-hole.toml](https://github.com/LuckyTurtleDev/crab-hole/blob/main/example-config.toml)


The following is a basic nix config using UDP as a downstream and Cloudflare as upstream.

```nix
{
  services.crab-hole = {
    enable = true;

    settings = {
      blocklist = {
        include_subdomains = true;
        lists = [
          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn/hosts"
          "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_tracking.txt"
        ];
      };

      downstream = [
        {
          protocol = "udp";
          listen = "127.0.0.1";
          port = 53;
        }
        {
          protocol = "udp";
          listen = "::1";
          port = 53;
        }
      ];

      upstream = {
        name_servers = [
          {
            socket_addr = "1.1.1.1:853";
            protocol = "tls";
            tls_dns_name = "1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com";
            trust_nx_responses = false;
          }
          {
            socket_addr = "[2606:4700:4700::1111]:853";
            protocol = "tls";
            tls_dns_name = "1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com";
            trust_nx_responses = false;
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

To test your setup, just query the DNS server with any domain like `example.com`.
To test if a domain gets blocked, just choose one of the domains from the blocklist.
If the server does not return an IP, this worked correctly.

### Downstream options {#module-services-crab-hole-downstream}
There are multiple protocols which are supported for the downstream:
UDP, TLS, HTTPS and QUIC.
Below you can find a brief overview over the various protocol options together with an example for each protocol.

#### UDP {#module-services-crab-hole-udp}
UDP is the simplest downstream, but it is not encrypted.
If you want encryption, you need to use another protocol.
***Note:** This also opens a TCP port*
```nix
{
  services.crab-hole.settings.downstream = [
    {
      protocol = "udp";
      listen = "localhost";
      port = 53;
    }
  ];
}
```

#### TLS {#module-services-crab-hole-tls}
TLS is a simple encrypted options to serve DNS.
It comes with similar settings to UDP,
but you additionally need a valid TLS certificate and its private key.
The later are specified via a path to the files.
A valid TLS certificate and private key can be obtained using services like ACME.
Make sure the crab-hole service user has access to these files.
Additionally you can set an optional timeout value.
```nix
{
  services.crab-hole.settings.downstream = [
    {
      protocol = "tls";
      listen = "[::]";
      port = 853;
      certificate = ./dns.example.com.crt;
      key = "/dns.example.com.key";
      # optional (default = 3000)
      timeout_ms = 3000
    }
  ];
}
```

#### HTTPS {#module-services-crab-hole-https}
HTTPS has similar settings to TLS, with the only difference being the additional `dns_hostname` option.
This protocol might need a reverse proxy if other HTTPS services are to share the same port.
Make sure the service has permissions to access the certificate and key.

***Note:** this config is untested*
```nix
{
  services.crab-hole.settings.downstream = [
    {
      protocol = "https";
      listen = "[::]";
      port = 443;
      certificate = ./dns.example.com.crt;
      key = "/dns.example.com.key";
      # optional
      dns_hostname = "dns.example.com";
      # optional (default = 3000)
      timeout_ms = 3000;
    }
  ];
}
```

#### QUIC {#module-services-crab-hole-quic}
QUIC has identical settings to the HTTPS protocol.
Since by default it doesn't run on the standard HTTPS port, you shouldn't need a reverse proxy.
Make sure the service has permissions to access the certificate and key.
```nix
{
  services.crab-hole.settings.downstream = [
    {
      protocol = "quic";
      listen = "127.0.0.1";
      port = 853;
      certificate = ./dns.example.com.crt;
      key = "/dns.example.com.key";
      # optional
      dns_hostname = "dns.example.com";
      # optional (default = 3000)
      timeout_ms = 3000;
    }
  ];
}
```

### Upstream options {#module-services-crab-hole-upstream-options}
You can set additional options of the underlying DNS server. A full list of all the options can be found in the [hickory-dns documentation](https://docs.rs/trust-dns-resolver/0.23.0/trust_dns_resolver/config/struct.ResolverOpts.html).

This can look like the following example.
```nix
{
  services.crab-hole.settings.upstream.options = {
    validate = false;
  };
}
```

#### DNSSEC Issues {#module-services-crab-hole-dnssec}
Due to an upstream issue of [hickory-dns](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2429), sites without DNSSEC will not be resolved if `validate = true`.
Only DNSSEC capable sites will be resolved with this setting.
To prevent this, set `validate = false` or omit the `[upstream.options]`.

### API {#module-services-crab-hole-api}
The API allows a user to fetch statistic and information about the crab-hole instance.
Basic information is availablee for everyone, while more detailed information is secured by a key, which will be set with the `admin_key` option.

```nix
{
  services.crab-hole.settings.api = {
    listen = "127.0.0.1";
    port = 8080;
    # optional (default = false)
    show_doc = true; # OpenAPI doc loads content from third party websites
    # optional
    admin_key = "1234";
  };
}

```

The documentation can be enabled seperately for the instance with `show_doc`.
This will then create an additional webserver, which hosts the API documentation.
An additional resource is in work in the [crab-hole repository](https://github.com/LuckyTurtleDev/crab-hole).

## Troubleshooting {#module-services-crab-hole-troubleshooting}
You can check for errors using `systemctl status crab-hole` or `journalctl -xeu crab-hole.service`.

### Invalid config {#module-services-crab-hole-invalid-config}
Some options of the service are in freeform and not type checked.
This can lead to a config which is not valid or cannot be parsed by crab-hole.
The error message will tell you what config value could not be parsed.
For more information check the [example config](https://github.com/LuckyTurtleDev/crab-hole/blob/main/example-config.toml).

### Permission Error {#module-services-crab-hole-permission-error}
It can happen that the created certificates for TLS, HTTPS or QUIC are owned by another user or group.
For ACME for example this would be `acme:acme`.
To give the crab-hole service access to these files, the group which owns the certificate can be added as a supplementary group to the service.
For ACME for example:
```nix
{
  services.crab-hole.supplementaryGroups = [ "acme" ];
}
```
