  # When importing ZFS pools, there's one difficulty: These scripts may run
  # before the backing devices (physical HDDs, etc.) of the pool have been
  # scanned and initialized.
  #
  # An attempted import with all devices missing will just fail, and can be
  # retried, but an import where e.g. two out of three disks in a three-way
  # mirror are missing, will succeed. This is a problem: When the missing disks
  # are later discovered, they won't be automatically set online, rendering the
  # pool redundancy-less (and far slower) until such time as the system reboots.
  #
  # The solution is the below. poolReady checks the status of an un-imported
  # pool, to see if *every* device is available -- in which case the pool will be
  # in state ONLINE, as opposed to DEGRADED, FAULTED or MISSING.
  #
  # The import scripts then loop over this, waiting until the pool is ready or a
  # sufficient amount of time has passed that we can assume it won't be. In the
  # latter case it makes one last attempt at importing, allowing the system to
  # (eventually) boot even with a degraded pool.

          Name or GUID of extra ZFS pools that you wish to import during boot.

          Usually this is not necessary. Instead, you should set the mountpoint property
          of ZFS filesystems to <literal>legacy</literal> and add the ZFS filesystems to
          NixOS's <option>fileSystems</option> option, which makes NixOS automatically
          import the associated pool.

          However, in some cases (e.g. if you have many filesystems) it may be preferable
          to exclusively use ZFS commands to manage filesystems. If so, since NixOS/systemd
          will not be managing those filesystems, you will need to specify the ZFS pool here
          so that NixOS automatically imports it on every boot.

          If you set this option to <literal>false</literal> and NixOS subsequently fails to
