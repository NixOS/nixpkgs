# This script's goal is to perform all "static" setup of a filesystem structure from pre-built store paths. Everything
# in here should run in a non-root context and inside a Nix builder. It's designed primarily to be called from image-
# building scripts and from nixos-install, but because it makes very few assumptions about the context in which it runs,
# it could be useful in other contexts as well.
#
# Current behavior:
#  - set up basic filesystem structure
#  - make Nix store etc.
#  - copy Nix, system, channel, and misceallaneous closures to target Nix store
#  - register validity of all paths in the target store
#  - set up channel and system profiles

# Ensure a consistent umask.
