* Hiding process information
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-hidepid
  :END:

Setting

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   = true;
#+END_EXAMPLE

ensures that access to process information is restricted to the owning
user. This implies, among other things, that command-line arguments
remain private. Unless your deployment relies on unprivileged users
being able to inspect the process information of other users, this
option should be safe to enable.

Members of the =proc= group are exempt from process information hiding.

To allow a service foo to run without process information hiding, set

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  systemd.services.foo.serviceConfig.SupplementaryGroups = [ "proc" ];
#+END_EXAMPLE
