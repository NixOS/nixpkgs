    // Some discussion was had around shot-gunning all of the
    // capabilities we know about into the Ambient set but that has a
    // security smell and I deemed the risk of the current
    // implementation crashing the program to be lower than the risk
    // of a privilege escalation security hole being introduced by
    // raising all capabilities, even ones we didn't intend for the
    // program, into the Ambient set.
    //
    // `cap_t` which is returned by `cap_get_*` is an opaque type and
    // even if we could retrieve the bitmasks (which, as far as I can
    // tell we cannot) in order to get the `cap_value_t`
    // representation for each capability we would have to take the
    // total number of capabilities supported and iterate over the
    // sequence of integers up-to that maximum total, testing each one
    // against the bitmask ((bitmask >> n) & 1) to see if it's set and
    // aggregating each "capability integer n" that is set in the
    // bitmask.
    //
    // That, combined with the fact that we can't easily get the
    // bitmask anyway seemed much more brittle than fetching the
    // `cap_t`, transforming it into a textual representation,
    // tokenizing the string, and using `cap_from_name` on the token
    // to get the `cap_value_t` that we need for `prctl`. There is
    // indeed risk involved if the output string format of
    // `cap_to_text` ever changes but at this time the combination of
    // factors involving the below list have led me to the conclusion
    // that the best implementation at this time is reading then
    // parsing with *lots of documentation* about why we're doing it
    // this way.
    //
    // 1. No explicit API for fetching an array of `cap_value_t`'s or
    //    for transforming a `cap_t` into such a representation
    // 2. The risk of a crash is lower than lifting all capabilities
    //    into the Ambient set
    // 3. libcap is depended on heavily in the Linux ecosystem so
    //    there is a high chance that the output representation of
    //    `cap_to_text` will not change which reduces our risk that
    //    this parsing step will cause a crash
    //
    // The preferred method, should it ever be available in the
    // future, would be to use libcap API's to transform the result
    // from a `cap_get_*` into an array of `cap_value_t`'s that can
    // then be given to prctl.
