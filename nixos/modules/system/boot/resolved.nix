            DNS server that supports DNSSEC. If the DNS server does
            not properly support DNSSEC all validations will fail.

            DNSSEC validation is attempted, but if the server does not
            support DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC mode is automatically
            disabled. Note that this mode makes DNSSEC validation
            vulnerable to "downgrade" attacks, where an attacker might
            be able to trigger a downgrade to non-DNSSEC mode by
            synthesizing a DNS response that suggests DNSSEC was not
            supported.
