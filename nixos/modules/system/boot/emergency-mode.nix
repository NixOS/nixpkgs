        Whether to enable emergency mode, which is an
        {command}`sulogin` shell started on the console if
        mounting a filesystem fails.  Since some machines (like EC2
        instances) have no console of any kind, emergency mode doesn't
        make sense, and it's better to continue with the boot insofar
        as possible.
