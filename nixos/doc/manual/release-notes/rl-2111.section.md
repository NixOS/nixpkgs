# Release 21.11 (“?”, 2021.11/??) {#release-21.11}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

* Support is planned until the end of April 2022, handing over to 22.05.

## Highlights

* PHP now defaults to PHP 8.0, updated from 7.4.

## New Services

* [geoipupdate](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate), a GeoIP
  database updater from MaxMind. Available as
  [services.geoipupdate](options.html#opt-services.geoipupdate.enable).

* [sourcehut](https://sr.ht), a collection of tools useful for software
  development. Available as
  [services.sourcehut](options.html#opt-services.sourcehut.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities

* The `staticjinja` package has been upgraded from 1.0.4 to 2.0.0

* `services.geoip-updater` was broken and has been replaced by
  [services.geoipupdate](options.html#opt-services.geoipupdate.enable).

* PHP 7.3 is no longer supported due to upstream not supporting this
  version for the entire lifecycle of the 21.11 release.

* Those making use of `buildBazelPackage` will need to regenerate the fetch
  hashes (preferred), or set `fetchConfigured = false;`.
