## Highlights {#sec-release-21.11-highlights}

- PHP now defaults to PHP 8.0, updated from 7.4.

## New Services {#sec-release-21.11-new-services}

- [geoipupdate](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate), a GeoIP database updater from MaxMind. Available as [services.geoipupdate](options.html#opt-services.geoipupdate.enable).

- [sourcehut](https://sr.ht), a collection of tools useful for software development. Available as [services.sourcehut](options.html#opt-services.sourcehut.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-21.11-incompatibilities}

- The `staticjinja` package has been upgraded from 1.0.4 to 2.0.0

- `services.geoip-updater` was broken and has been replaced by [services.geoipupdate](options.html#opt-services.geoipupdate.enable).

- PHP 7.3 is no longer supported due to upstream not supporting this version for the entire lifecycle of the 21.11 release.

- Those making use of `buildBazelPackage` will need to regenerate the fetch hashes (preferred), or set `fetchConfigured = false;`.

- `consul` was upgraded to a new major release with breaking changes, see [upstream changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.10.0).

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-21.11-notable-changes}

- The setting [`services.openssh.logLevel`](options.html#opt-services.openssh.logLevel) `"VERBOSE"` `"INFO"`. This brings NixOS in line with upstream and other Linux distributions, and reduces log spam on servers due to bruteforcing botnets.

  However, if [`services.fail2ban.enable`](options.html#opt-services.fail2ban.enable) is `true`, the `fail2ban` will override the verbosity to `"VERBOSE"`, so that `fail2ban` can observe the failed login attempts from the SSH logs.

- Sway: The terminal emulator `rxvt-unicode` is no longer installed by default via `programs.sway.extraPackages`. The current default configuration uses `alacritty` (and soon `foot`) so this is only an issue when using a customized configuration and not installing `rxvt-unicode` explicitly.
