- `yggdrasil` was upgraded to a new major release with breaking changes, see [upstream changelog](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

- `icingaweb2` was upgraded to a new release which requires a manual database upgrade, see [upstream changelog](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.9.0).

- The `isabelle` package has been upgraded from 2020 to 2021

- the `mingw-64` package has been upgraded from 6.0.0 to 9.0.0

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-21.11-notable-changes}

- The setting [`services.openssh.logLevel`](options.html#opt-services.openssh.logLevel) `"VERBOSE"` `"INFO"`. This brings NixOS in line with upstream and other Linux distributions, and reduces log spam on servers due to bruteforcing botnets.

  However, if [`services.fail2ban.enable`](options.html#opt-services.fail2ban.enable) is `true`, the `fail2ban` will override the verbosity to `"VERBOSE"`, so that `fail2ban` can observe the failed login attempts from the SSH logs.

- Sway: The terminal emulator `rxvt-unicode` is no longer installed by default via `programs.sway.extraPackages`. The current default configuration uses `alacritty` (and soon `foot`) so this is only an issue when using a customized configuration and not installing `rxvt-unicode` explicitly.

- `python3` now defaults to Python 3.9. Python 3.9 introduces many deprecation warnings, please look at the [What's New In Python 3.9 post](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html) for more information.

- The `claws-mail` package now references the new GTK+ 3 release branch, major version 4. To use the GTK+ 2 releases, one can install the `claws-mail-gtk2` package.

- The wordpress module provides a new interface which allows to use different webservers with the new option [`services.wordpress.webserver`](options.html#opt-services.wordpress.webserver).  Currently `httpd` and `nginx` are supported. The definitions of wordpress sites should now be set in [`services.wordpress.sites`](options.html#opt-services.wordpress.sites).

  Sites definitions that use the old interface are automatically migrated in the new option. This backward compatibility will be removed in 22.05.

- The order of NSS (host) modules has been brought in line with upstream
  recommendations:

  - The `myhostname` module is placed before the `resolve` (optional) and `dns`
    entries, but after `file` (to allow overriding via `/etc/hosts` /
    `networking.extraHosts`, and prevent ISPs with catchall-DNS resolvers from
    hijacking `.localhost` domains)
  - The `mymachines` module, which provides hostname resolution for local
    containers (registered with `systemd-machined`) is placed to the front, to
    make sure its mappings are preferred over other resolvers.
  - If systemd-networkd is enabled, the `resolve` module is placed before
    `files` and `myhostname`, as it provides the same logic internally, with
    caching.
  - The `mdns(_minimal)` module has been updated to the new priorities.

  If you use your own NSS host modules, make sure to update your priorities
  according to these rules:

  - NSS modules which should be queried before `resolved` DNS resolution should
    use mkBefore.
  - NSS modules which should be queried after `resolved`, `files` and
    `myhostname`, but before `dns` should use the default priority
  - NSS modules which should come after `dns` should use mkAfter.
