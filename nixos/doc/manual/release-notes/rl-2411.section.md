## Highlights {#sec-release-24.11-highlights}

- **This will be the last release of Nixpkgs to support macOS Sierra 10.12 to macOS Catalina 10.15.**
  Starting with release 25.05, the minimum supported version will be macOS Big Sur 11, and we cannot guarantee that packages will continue to work on older versions of macOS.
  Users on old macOS versions should consider upgrading to a supported version (potentially using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) for old hardware) or installing NixOS.
  If neither of those options are viable and you require new versions of software, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) supports back to Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.
- Nix was updated to 2.24, which brings a lot of improvements and fixes. See the release notes for
    [2.19](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/release-notes/rl-2.19),
    [2.20](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/release-notes/rl-2.20),
    [2.21](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/release-notes/rl-2.21),
    [2.22](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/release-notes/rl-2.22),
    [2.23](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/release-notes/rl-2.23),
    [2.24](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/release-notes/rl-2.24).
  Notable changes include improvements to Git fetching, documentation comment support in `nix-repl> :doc`, as well as many quality of life improvements.

- This will be the last release of Nixpkgs to support versions of CUDA prior to CUDA 12.0.
  These versions only work with old compiler versions that will be unsupported by the time of the Nixpkgs 25.05 release.
  In future, users should expect CUDA versions to be dropped as the compiler versions they require leave upstream support windows.

- GCC now defaults to major version 14 from previous 13. ([GCC Porting Guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html))

- Convenience options for `amdgpu`, open source driver for Radeon cards, is now available under `hardware.amdgpu`.

- [AMDVLK](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK), AMD's open source Vulkan driver, is now available to be configured as `hardware.amdgpu.amdvlk` option.
  This also allows configuring runtime settings of AMDVLK and enabling experimental features.
- The `moonlight-qt` package ([Moonlight game streaming](https://moonlight-stream.org/)) now has HDR support on Linux systems.

- PostgreSQL now defaults to major version 16.

- `authelia` has been upgraded to version 4.38. This version brings several features and improvements which are detailed in the [release blog post](https://www.authelia.com/blog/4.38-release-notes/).
  This release also deprecates some configuration keys, which are likely to be removed in future version 5.0, but they are still supported and expected to be working in the current version.

- `compressDrv` can compress selected files in a derivation. `compressDrvWeb` compresses files for common web server usage (`.gz` with `zopfli`, `.br` with `brotli`).

- `hardware.display` is a new module implementing workarounds for misbehaving monitors
  through setting up custom EDID files and forcing kernel/framebuffer modes.

- A new display-manager `services.displayManager.ly` was added.
  It is a tui based replacement of sddm and lightdm for window manager users.
  Users can use it by `services.displayManager.ly.enable` and config it by
  `services.displayManager.ly.settings` to generate `/etc/ly/config.ini`

- The default sound server for most graphical sessions has been switched from PulseAudio to PipeWire.
  Users that want to keep PulseAudio will want to set `services.pipewire.enable = false;` and `hardware.pulseaudio.enable = true;`.
  There is currently no plan to fully deprecate and remove PulseAudio, however, PipeWire should generally be preferred for new installs.

- The Rust rewrite of the `switch-to-configuration` program is now used for system activation by default.
  If you experience any issues, please report them.
  The original Perl script can still be used for now by setting `system.switch.enableNg` to `false`.

- Support for mounting filesystems from block devices protected with [dm-verity](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html)
  was added through the `boot.initrd.systemd.dmVerity` option.

- The [Xen Project Hypervisor](https://xenproject.org) is once again available as a virtualisation option under [`virtualisation.xen`](#opt-virtualisation.xen.enable).
  - This release includes Xen [4.19.0](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Project_4.19_Release_Notes) and support for booting the hypervisor on EFI systems.
  ::: {.warning}
    Booting into the Xen Project Hypervisor through a legacy BIOS bootloader or with the legacy script-based Stage 1 initrd have been **deprecated**. Only EFI booting and the new systemd-based Stage 1 initrd are supported.
  :::
  - The `qemu-xen-traditional` component has been deprecated by the upstream Xen Project, and is no longer included in the Xen build.
  - The OCaml-based Xen Store can now be configured using  [`virtualisation.xen.store.settings`](#opt-virtualisation.xen.store.settings).
  - The `virtualisation.xen.bridge` options have been deprecated in this release cycle. Users who need network bridges are encouraged to set up their own networking configurations.

- A new option [`systemd.enableStrictShellChecks`](#opt-systemd.enableStrictShellChecks) has been added. When enabled, all systemd scripts generated by NixOS will
  be checked with [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) and any errors or warnings will cause the build to fail.
  This affects all scripts that have been created through the `script`, `reload`, `preStart`, `postStart`, `preStop` and `postStop` options for systemd services.
  This does not affect commandlines passed directly to `ExecStart`, `ExecReload`, `ExecStartPre`, `ExecStartPost`, `ExecStop` or `ExecStopPost`.
  It therefore also does not affect systemd units that are coming from packages and that are not defined through the NixOS config.
  This option is disabled by default, and although some services have already been fixed, it is still likely that you will encounter build failures when enabling this.
  We encourage people to enable this option when they are willing and able to submit fixes for potential build failures to nixpkgs.
  The option can also be enabled or disabled for individual services using the `enableStrictShellChecks` option on the service itself, which will take precedence over the global setting.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-24.11-incompatibilities}

- The `sound` options have been removed or renamed, as they had a lot of unintended side effects. See [below](#sec-release-24.11-migration-sound) for details.

- The nvidia driver no longer defaults to the proprietary driver starting with version 560. You will need to manually set `hardware.nvidia.open` to select the proprietary or open driver.

- The `(buildPythonPackage { ... }).override` attribute is now deprecated and removed in favour of `overridePythonAttrs`.
  This change does not affect the override interface of most Python packages, as [`<pkg>.override`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-pkg-override) provided by `callPackage` shadows such a locally-defined `override` attribute.

- All Cinnamon and XApp packages have been moved to top-level (i.e., `cinnamon.nemo` is now `nemo`).

- All GNOME packages have been moved to top-level (i.e., `gnome.nautilus` is now `nautilus`).

- `transmission` package has been aliased with a `trace` warning to `transmission_3`. Since [Transmission 4 has been released last year](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/releases/tag/4.0.0), and Transmission 3 will eventually go away, it was decided perform this warning alias to make people aware of the new version. The `services.transmission.package` defaults to `transmission_3` as well because the upgrade can cause data loss in certain specific usage patterns (examples: [#5153](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/issues/5153), [#6796](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/issues/6796)). Please make sure to back up to your data directory per your usage:
  - `transmission-gtk`: `~/.config/transmission`
  - `transmission-daemon` using NixOS module: `${config.services.transmission.home}/.config/transmission-daemon` (defaults to `/var/lib/transmission/.config/transmission-daemon`)

- The default `mongodb` version has been updated from 5.0 to 7.0.
  For more information, see the compatibility changes for MongoDB [6.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0-compatibility/) and [7.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0-compatibility/).

- `unifi` has been updated to UniFi 8.
  `unifi7` was removed as it is vulnerable to CVE-2024-42025 and required a version of MongoDB that has reached end of life.

- `androidenv.androidPkgs_9_0` has been removed, and replaced with `androidenv.androidPkgs` for a more complete Android SDK including support for Android 9 and later.

- `grafana` has been updated to version 11.1. This version doesn't support setting `http_addr` to a hostname anymore, an IP address is expected.

- `deno` has been updated to v2 which has breaking changes. Upstream will be abandoning v1 soon but for now you can use `deno_1` if you are yet to migrate (will be removed prior to cutting a final 24.11 release).

- `gogs` has been removed. Upstream development has stalled and it has several
  [critical vulnerabilities](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/7777) that weren't addressed
  within a year. Consider migrating to `forgejo` or `gitea`.

- `knot-dns` has been updated to version 3.4.x. Check the [migration guide](https://www.knot-dns.cz/docs/latest/html/migration.html#upgrade-3-3-x-to-3-4-x) for breaking changes.

- `services.kubernetes.kubelet.clusterDns` now accepts a list of DNS resolvers rather than a single string, bringing the module more in line with the upstream Kubelet configuration schema.

- `bluemap` has changed the format used to store map tiles, and the database layout has been heavily modified. Upstream recommends a clean reinstallation: <https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/releases/tag/v5.2>. Unless you are using an SQL storage backend, this should only entail deleting the contents of `config.services.bluemap.coreSettings.data` (defaults to `/var/lib/bluemap`) and `config.services.bluemap.webRoot` (defaults to `/var/lib/bluemap/web`).

- `wstunnel` has had a major version upgrade that entailed rewriting the program in Rust.
  The module was updated to accommodate for breaking changes.
  Breaking changes to the module API were minimised as much as possible,
  but some were nonetheless inevitable due to changes in the upstream CLI.
  Certain options were moved from separate CLI arguments into the forward specifications,
  and those options were also removed from the module's API,
  please consult the wstunnel man page for more detail.
  Also be aware that if you have set additional options in `services.wstunnel.{clients,servers}.<name>.extraArgs`,
  that those might have been removed or modified upstream.

- `percona-server_8_4` and `mysql84` now have password authentication via the deprecated `mysql_native_password` disabled by default. This authentication plugin can be enabled via a CLI argument again, for detailed instructions and alternative authentication methods [see upstream documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/native-pluggable-authentication.html). The config file directive `default_authentication_plugin` has been removed.

- Percona has decided not to follow the LTS/ Innovation release scheme of upstream MySQL and thus [will only create releases for MySQL LTS versions](https://www.percona.com/blog/no-mysql-9-x-innovation-releases-from-percona/). Hence, the package names `percona-server_lts`, `percona-server_innovation`, `percona-xtrabackup_lts` and `percona-xtrabackup_innovation` are deprecated.
  - `percona-server` and `percona-server_lts` now point towards the new LTS release `percona-server_8_4`. The previous LTS continues to be supported and is available as `percona-server_8_0`. The same is true for the supporting `percona-xtrabackup` tooling.

- `clang-tools_<version>` packages have been moved into `llvmPackages_<version>` (i.e. `clang-tools_18` is now `llvmPackages_18.clang-tools`).
  - For convenience, the top-level `clang-tools` attribute remains and is now bound to `llvmPackages.clang-tools`.
  - Top-level `clang_tools_<version>` attributes are now aliases; these will be removed in a future release.

- `buildbot` was updated to 4.0, the AngularJS frontend has been replaced by a React frontend, see the [upstream release notes](https://docs.buildbot.net/current/manual/upgrading/4.0-upgrade.html).

- `headscale` has been updated to version 0.23.0 which reworked large parts of the configuration including DNS, Magic DNS prefixes and ACL policy files. See the [upstream changelog](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/releases/tag/v0.23.0) for details.

- `nginx` package no longer includes `gd` and `geoip` dependencies. For enabling it, override `nginx` package with the optionals `withImageFilter` and `withGeoIP`.

- `systemd.enableUnifiedCgroupHierarchy` option has been removed.
  In systemd 256 support for cgroup v1 ('legacy' and 'hybrid' hierarchies) is now considered obsolete and systemd by default will refuse to boot under it.
  To forcibly reenable cgroup v1 support, you can `set boot.kernelParams = [ "systemd.unified_cgroup_hierachy=0" "SYSTEMD_CGROUP_ENABLE_LEGACY_FORCE=1" ]`.
  NixOS does not officially support this configuration and might cause your system to be unbootable in future versions. You are on your own.

- `nrfutil` which previously pointed to the now-deprecated `pc-nrfutil` python package, has been repackaged under the same name with the new nrfutil tool.

- `openssh` and `openssh_hpn` are now compiled without Kerberos 5 / GSSAPI support in an effort to reduce the attack surface of the components for the majority of users. Users needing this support can
  use the new `opensshWithKerberos` and `openssh_hpnWithKerberos` flavors (e.g. `programs.ssh.package = pkgs.openssh_gssapi`).

- `security.ipa.ipaHostname` now defaults to the value of `networking.fqdn` if
  it is set, instead of the previous hardcoded default of
  `${networking.hostName}.${security.ipa.domain}`.

- The `MSMTP_QUEUE` and `MSMTP_LOG` environment variables accepted by `msmtpq` have now been renamed to `MSMTPQ_Q` and `MSMTPQ_LOG` respectively.

- The logrotate service has received hardening and now requires enabling `allowNetworking`, if logrotate needs to access the network.

- `mautrix-whatsapp` has been updated to version 0.11.0, which is a major rewrite of the bridge. Config file changes are required.

- qBittorrent has been updated to major version 5, which drops support for Qt 5.
  The `qbittorrent-qt5` package has been removed.

- The fcgiwrap module now allows multiple instances running as distinct users.
  The option `services.fgciwrap` now takes an attribute set of the
  configuration of each individual instance.
  This requires migrating any previous configuration keys from
  `services.fcgiwrap.*` to `services.fcgiwrap.instances.some-instance.*`.
  The ownership and mode of the UNIX sockets created by this service are now
  configurable and private by default.
  Processes also now run as a dynamically allocated user by default instead of
  root.

- The `mautrix-signal` module was adapted to incorporate the configuration rearrangement that resulted from the update to the mautrix bridgev2 architecture. Pre-0.7.0 configurations should continue to work.
  In case you want to update your configuration make sure to check the NixOS manual.

- `singularity-tools` have the `storeDir` argument removed from its override interface and use `builtins.storeDir` instead.

- Two build helpers in `singularity-tools`, i.e., `mkLayer` and `shellScript`, are deprecated, as they are no longer involved in image-building. Maintainers will remove them in future releases.

- The `rust.toTargetArch`, `rust.toTargetOs`, `rust.toTargetFamily`, `rust.toTargetVendor`, `rust.toRustTarget`, `rust.toRustTargetSpec`, `rust.toRustTargetSpecShort`, and `rust.IsNoStdTarget` functions are deprecated in favour of the `rust.platform.arch`, `rust.platform.os`, `rust.platform.target-family`, `rust.platform.vendor`, `rust.rustcTarget`, `rust.rustcTargetSpec`, `rust.cargoShortTarget`, `rust.cargoEnvVarTarget`, and `rust.isNoStdTarget` platform attributes respectively.

- The `budgie` and `budgiePlugins` scope have been removed and their packages
  moved into the top level scope (i.e., `budgie.budgie-desktop` is now
  `budgie-desktop`)

- The method to safely handle secrets in the `networking.wireless` module has been changed to benefit from a [new feature](https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=e680a51e94a33591f61edb210926bcb71217a21a) of wpa_supplicant.
  The syntax to refer to secrets has changed slightly and the option `networking.wireless.environmentFile` has been replaced by `networking.wireless.secretsFile`; see the description of the latter for how to upgrade.

- `services.cgit` now runs as the cgit user by default instead of root.
  This change requires granting access to the repositories to this user or
  setting the appropriate one through `services.cgit.some-instance.user`.

- `nvimpager` was updated to version 0.13.0, which changes the order of user and
  nvimpager settings: user commands in `-c` and `--cmd` now override the
  respective default settings because they are executed later.

- Kubernetes `featureGates` have changed from a `listOf str` to `attrsOf bool`.
  This refactor makes it possible to also disable feature gates, without having
  to use `extraOpts` flags.

  A previous configuration may have looked like this:
  ```nix
  featureGates = [ "EphemeralContainers" ];
  extraOpts = pkgs.lib.concatStringsSep " " (
  [
    ''--feature-gates="CSIMigration=false"''
  });
  ```

  Using an AttrSet instead, the new configuration would be:
  ```nix
  featureGates = {EphemeralContainers = true; CSIMigration=false;};
  ```

- `pkgs.nextcloud27` has been removed since it's EOL.

- The `environment.noXlibs` option has been removed. It was a common source of unexpected rebuilds and breakage that was often hard to diagnose.
  If you need to disable certain libraries, you're encouraged to add your own overlay to your configuration that targets the packages you care about.

- `frigate` was updated past 0.14.0. This release includes various breaking changes, so please go read the [release notes](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/releases/tag/v0.14.0).
   Most prominently access to the webinterface and API are now protected by authentication. Retrieve the auto-created
   admin account from the `frigate.service` journal after upgrading.

- `nodePackages.coc-python` was dropped, as [its upstream is unmaintained](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-python). The associated `vimPlugins.coc-python` was also dropped.
  The upstream project recommends using `coc-pyright` or `coc-jedi` as replacements.

- `forgejo` has been upgraded from version 7.0 to version 9.0, see the release notes for [8.0](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/RELEASE-NOTES.md#8-0-0) and [9.0](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/milestone/7235).

- `services.forgejo.mailerPasswordFile` has been deprecated by the drop-in replacement `services.forgejo.secrets.mailer.PASSWD`,
  which is part of the new free-form `services.forgejo.secrets` option.
  `services.forgejo.secrets` is a small wrapper over systemd's `LoadCredential=`. It has the same structure (sections/keys) as
  `services.forgejo.settings` but takes file paths that will be read before service startup instead of some plaintext value.
  `services.forgejo.package` now defaults to `forgejo-lts`, the Long Term Support version of Forgejo.

- `forgejo` and `forgejo-lts` no longer support the opt-in feature [PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/authentication/#pam-pluggable-authentication-module).

- `gitea` no longer supports the opt-in feature [PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)](https://docs.gitea.com/usage/authentication#pam-pluggable-authentication-module).

- `services.ddclient.use` has been deprecated: `ddclient` now supports separate IPv4 and IPv6 configuration. Use `services.ddclient.usev4` and `services.ddclient.usev6` instead.

- `services.pgbouncer` systemd service is configured with `Type=notify-reload` and allows reloading configuration without process restart. PgBouncer configuration options were moved to the free-form type option named [`services.pgbouncer.settings`](#opt-services.pgbouncer.settings) according to the NixOS RFC 0042.

- `nodePackages.coc-metals` was removed due to being deprecated upstream.
  `vimPlugins.nvim-metals` is its official replacement.

- `teleport` has been upgraded from major version 15 to major version 16.
  Refer to upstream [upgrade instructions](https://goteleport.com/docs/management/operations/upgrading/)
  and [release notes for v16](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1600-061324).

- `tests.overriding` has its `passthru.tests` restructured as an attribute set instead of a list, making individual tests accessible by their names.

- Package `skk-dict` was split into multiple packages under `skkDictionaries`.
  If in doubt, try `skkDictionaries.l`. As part of this change, the dictionaries
  were moved from `$out/share` to `$out/share/skk`. Also, the dictionaries won't
  be converted to UTF-8 unless the `useUtf8` package option is enabled. UTF-8
  converted dictionaries will have the .utf8 suffix appended to its filename.

- `vaultwarden` lost the capability to bind to privileged ports. If you rely on
   this behavior, override the systemd unit to allow `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` in
   your local configuration.

- The Invoiceplane module now only accepts the structured `settings` option.
  `extraConfig` is now removed.

- The `ollama` services replaces its `sandbox` toggle with options to configure
  a static `user` and `group`. The `writablePaths` option has been removed and
  the models directory is now always exempt from sandboxing.

- The `gns3-server` service now runs under the `gns3` system user
  instead of a dynamically created one via `DynamicUser`.
  The use of SUID wrappers is incompatible with SystemD's `DynamicUser` setting,
  and GNS3 requires calling ubridge through its SUID wrapper to function properly.
  This change requires to manually move the following directories:
    * from `/var/lib/private/gns3` to `/var/lib/gns3`
    * from `/var/log/private/gns3` to `/var/log/gns3`
  and to change the ownership of these directories and their contents to `gns3` (including `/etc/gns3`).

- Legacy package `stalwart-mail_0_6` was dropped, please note the
  [manual upgrade process](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server/blob/main/UPGRADING.md)
  before changing the package to `pkgs.stalwart-mail` in
  [`services.stalwart-mail.package`](#opt-services.stalwart-mail.package).

- The `nomad_1_5` package was dropped, as [it has reached end-of-life upstream](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021185113-Support-Period-and-End-of-Life-EOL-Policy). Evaluating it will throw an error.

- `androidndkPkgs` has been updated to `androidndkPkgs_26`.

- Android NDK version 26 and SDK version 33 are now the default versions used for cross compilation to android.

- the `ankisyncd` package and its `services.ankisyncd` have been removed, use [`services.anki-sync-server`](#opt-services.anki-sync-server.enable) instead.

- `nodePackages.vscode-css-languageserver-bin`, `nodePackages.vscode-html-languageserver-bin`,
  and `nodePackages.vscode-json-languageserver-bin` were dropped due to an unmaintained upstream.
  The `vscode-langservers-extracted` package is a maintained drop-in replacement.

- `nodePackages.prisma` has been replaced by `prisma`.

- `fetchNextcloudApp` has been rewritten to use `fetchurl` rather than
  `fetchzip`. This invalidates all existing hashes but you can restore the old
  behavior by passing it `unpack = true`.

- `haskell.lib.compose.justStaticExecutables` now disallows references to GHC in the
  output by default, to alert users to closure size issues caused by
  [#164630](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/164630). See ["Packaging
  Helpers" in the Haskell section of the Nixpkgs
  manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#haskell-packaging-helpers)
  for information on working around `output '...' is not allowed to refer to
  the following paths` errors caused by this change.

- The `stalwart-mail` service now runs under the `stalwart-mail` system user
  instead of a dynamically created one via `DynamicUser`, to avoid automatic
  ownership changes on its large file store each time the service was started.
  This change requires to manually move the state directory from
  `/var/lib/private/stalwart-mail` to `/var/lib/stalwart-mail` and to
  change the ownership of the directory and its content to `stalwart-mail`.

- The `stalwart-mail` module now uses RocksDB as the default storage backend
  for `stateVersion` ≥ 24.11. (It was previously using SQLite for structured
  data and the filesystem for blobs).

- The `stargazer` service has been hardened to improve security, but these
  changes make break certain setups, particularly around traditional CGI.

  - The `stargazer.allowCgiUser` option has been added, enabling
    Stargazer's `cgi-user` option to work, which was previously broken.

- The `shiori` service now requires an HTTP secret value `SHIORI_HTTP_SECRET_KEY` to be provided via environment variable. The nixos module therefore, now provides an environmentFile option:

  ```
  # This is how a environment file can be generated:
  # $ printf "SHIORI_HTTP_SECRET_KEY=%s\n" "$(openssl rand -hex 16)" > /path/to/env-file
  services.shiori.environmentFile = "/path/to/env-file";
  ```

- `/share/nano` is now only linked when `programs.nano.enable` is enabled.

- PPD files for Utax printers got renamed (spaces replaced by underscores) in newest `foomatic-db` package; users of Utax printers might need to adapt their `hardware.printers.ensurePrinters.*.model` value.

- The `kvdo` kernel module package was removed, because it was upstreamed in kernel version 6.9, where it is called `dm-vdo`.

- `libe57format` has been updated to `>= 3.0.0`, which contains some backward-incompatible API changes. See the [release note](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for more details.

- `gitlab` deprecated support for *runner registration tokens* in GitLab 16.0, disabled their support in GitLab 17.0 and will
  ultimately remove it in GitLab 18.0, as outlined in the
  [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/17.0/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html#estimated-time-frame-for-planned-changes).
  After upgrading to GitLab >= 17.0, it is possible to re-enable support for registration tokens in the UI until GitLab 18.0.
  Refer to the manual on [using registration tokens after GitLab 17.0](https://docs.gitlab.com/17.0/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html#using-registration-tokens-after-gitlab-170).
  GitLab administrators should migrate to the [new runner registration workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/17.0/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html#using-registration-tokens-after-gitlab-170)
  with *runner authentication tokens* until the release of GitLab 18.0.

- `gitlab` has been updated from 16.x to 17.x and requires at least `postgresql` 14.9, as stated in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/17.1/ee/install/requirements.html#postgresql-requirements). Check the [upgrade guide](#module-services-postgres-upgrading) in the NixOS manual on how to upgrade your PostgreSQL installation.

- `gitaly` (part of `gitlab`) is now using the bundled `git` package instead of `pkgs.git` to maintain compatibility with GitLab.

- `nixos/gitlab` no longer adds `pkgs.git` to `environment.systemPackages` by default.

- The `replay-sorcery` package and module was removed as it unmaintained upstream. Consider using `gpu-screen-recorder` or `obs-studio` instead.

- To follow [RFC 0042](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-config-option.md) a few options of `samba` have been moved from `extraConfig` and `configText` to the new freeform option `settings` and renamed, e.g.:
  - `services.samba.invalidUsers` to `services.samba.settings.global."invalid users"`
  - `services.samba.securityType` to `services.samba.settings.global."security type"`
  - `services.samba.shares` to `services.samba.settings`
  - `services.samba.enableWinbindd` to `services.samba.winbindd.enable`
  - `services.samba.enableNmbd` to `services.samba.nmbd.enable`

- `zx` was updated to v8, which introduces several breaking changes.
  See the [v8 changelog](https://github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/8.0.0) for more information.

- `feishin` removed support for Navidrome `< v0.53.2` due to an API change; more information in the [v0.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin/releases/tag/v0.10.0).

- The `dnscrypt-wrapper` module was removed since the project has been effectively unmaintained since 2018; moreover the NixOS module had to rely on an abandoned version of dnscrypt-proxy v1 for the rotation of keys.
  To wrap a resolver with DNSCrypt you can instead use `dnsdist`. See options `services.dnsdist.dnscrypt.*`

- The `portunus` package and service do not support weak password hashes anymore.
  If you installed Portunus on NixOS 23.11 or earlier, upgrade to NixOS 24.05 first to get support for strong password hashing.
  Then, follow the instructions on the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/majewsky/portunus/releases/tag/v2.0.0) to upgrade all existing user accounts to strong password hashes.
  If you need to upgrade to 24.11 without having completed the migration, consider the security implications of weak password hashes on your user accounts, and add the following to your configuration:
  ```nix
  services.portunus.package      = pkgs.portunus.override { libxcrypt = pkgs.libxcrypt-legacy; };
  services.portunus.ldap.package = pkgs.openldap.override { libxcrypt = pkgs.libxcrypt-legacy; };
  ```

- The default value of `services.kubernetes.kubelet.hostname` is now lowercased.
  Explicitly set `kubelet.hostname` to `networking.fqdnOrHostName` to get back
  the old default behavior.

- Docker now defaults to 27.x, because version 24.x stopped receiving security updates and bug fixes after [February 1, 2024](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46772#discussion_r1686464084).

- `postgresql` was split into default and -dev outputs. To make this work without circular dependencies, the output of the `pg_config` system view has been removed. The `pg_config` binary is provided in the -dev output and still works as expected.

- `keycloak` was updated to version 25, which introduces new hostname related options.
  See [Upgrading Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/25.0.1/upgrading/#migrating-to-25-0-0) for instructions.

- `programs.vim.defaultEditor` now only works if `programs.vim.enable` is enabled.

- `services.mautrix-meta` was updated to [0.4](https://github.com/mautrix/meta/releases/tag/v0.4.0). This release makes significant changes to the settings format. If you have custom settings you should migrate them to the new format. Unfortunately upstream provides little guidance for how to do this, but [the auto-migration code](https://github.com/mautrix/meta/blob/f5440b05aac125b4c95b1af85635a717cbc6dd0e/cmd/mautrix-meta/legacymigrate.go#L23) may serve as a useful reference. The NixOS module should warn you if you still have any old settings configured.

- The `nodePackages.shout` package has been removed because it was deprecated upstream in favor of `thelounge`.
  The `shout` top-level attribute was an alias to this package.
  The associated `services.shout` module has also been removed.

- The `indi-full` package no longer contains non-free drivers.
  To get the old collection of drivers use `indi-full-nonfree` or create your own collection of drivers by overriding indi-with-drivers.
  E.g.: `pkgs.indi-with-drivers.override {extraDrivers = with pkgs.indi-3rdparty; [indi-gphoto];}`

- `/share/vim-plugins` now only gets linked if `programs.vim.enable` is enabled

- The `tracy` package no longer works on X11, since it's moved to Wayland
  support, which is the intended default behavior by Tracy maintainers.
  X11 users have to switch to the new package `tracy-x11`.

- The `services.prometheus.exporters.minio` option has been removed, as it's upstream implementation was broken and unmaintained.
  Minio now has built-in [Prometheus metrics exposure](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/monitoring/collect-minio-metrics-using-prometheus.html), which can be used instead.

- The `services.patroni.raft` option has been removed, as Raft has been [deprecated by upstream since 3.0.0](https://github.com/patroni/patroni/blob/master/docs/releases.rst#version-300)

- `services.roundcube.maxAttachmentSize` will multiply the value set with `1.37` to offset overhead introduced by the base64 encoding applied to attachments.

- The `services.mxisd` module has been removed as both [mxisd](https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd) and [ma1sd](https://github.com/ma1uta/ma1sd) are not maintained any longer.
  Consequently the package `pkgs.ma1sd` has also been removed.

- `ffmpeg_5` has been removed. Please use the unversioned `ffmpeg`,
  pin a newer version, or if necessary pin `ffmpeg_4` for compatibility.

- The `rss-bridge` service drops the support to load a configuration file from `${config.services.rss-bridge.dataDir}/config.ini.php`.
  Consider using the `services.rss-bridge.config` option instead.

- The `xdg.portal.gtkUsePortal` option has been removed, as it had been deprecated for over 2 years. Using the `GTK_USE_PORTAL` environment variable in this manner is not intended nor encouraged by the GTK developers, but can still be done manually via `environment.sessionVariables`.

- Support for the legacy CUPS browsing and LDAP have been removed from `services.printing`. If `cups` or `ldap` are in the `BrowseRemoteProtocols` setting in `services.printing.browsedConf`, it needs to be removed.

- The `services.trust-dns` module has been renamed to `services.hickory-dns`.

- The option `services.prometheus.exporters.pgbouncer.connectionStringFile` has been removed since
  it leaked the connection string (and thus potentially the DB password) into the cmdline
  of process making it effectively world-readable.

  Use [`services.prometheus.exporters.pgbouncer.connectionEnvFile`](#opt-services.prometheus.exporters.pgbouncer.connectionEnvFile) instead.

- The `lsh` package and the `services.lshd` module have been removed as they had no maintainer in Nixpkgs and hadn’t seen an upstream release in over a decade. It is recommended to migrate to `openssh` and `services.openssh`.

- `ceph` has been upgraded to v19. See the [Ceph "squid" release notes](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/releases/squid/#v19-2-0-squid) for details and recommended upgrade procedure.

- `services.frr` has been refactored to use upstream service scripts. The per-daemon configurations
  have been removed in favour of an `integrated-vtysh-config` style config. The daemon submodules
  now use the daemon name (e.g. `ospfd`) instead of the protocol name (`ospf`). The daemons `zebra`,
  `mgmtd` and `staticd` are always enabled if a config is present. The `vtyListenAddress` and
  `vtyListenPort` options have been removed; use `options` or `extraOptions` instead, respectively.

- `opencv2` and `opencv3` have been removed, as they are obsolete and
  were not used by any other package. External users are encouraged to
  migrate to OpenCV 4.

- The `tvheadend` package and the `services.tvheadend` module have been
  removed as nobody was willing to maintain them and they were stuck on
  an unmaintained version that required FFmpeg 4; please see [pull
  request #332259](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/332259) if you
  are interested in maintaining a newer version.

- The `antennas` package and the `services.antennas` module have been
  removed as they only work with `tvheadend` (see above).

- The `system.build.brightboxImage` image has been removed as It did not build anymore and has not seen any maintenance in over 7 years (excluding tree-wide changes).

- The `services.syncplay` module now exposes all currently available command-line arguments for `syncplay-server` as options, as well as a `useACMEHost` option for easy TLS setup.
  The systemd service now uses `DynamicUser`/`StateDirectory` and the `user` and `group` options have been deprecated.

- The `openlens` package got removed, suggested replacement `lens-desktop`

- The `services.dnsmasq.extraConfig` option has been removed, as it had been deprecated for over 2 years. This option has been replaced by `services.dnsmasq.settings`.

- The NixOS installation media no longer support the ReiserFS or JFS file systems by default.

- Minimal installer ISOs are no longer built on the small channel.
  Please obtain installer images from the full release channels.

- The `isync` package has been updated to version `1.5.0`, which introduces some breaking changes. See the [compatibility concerns](https://sourceforge.net/projects/isync/files/isync/1.5.0/) for more details.

- Legacy package `globalprotect-openconnect` 1.x and related module
  `globalprotect-vpn` were dropped. Two new packages `gpauth` and `gpclient`
  from the 2.x version of the GlobalProtect-openconnect project are added in its
  place. The GUI components related to the project are non-free and not
  packaged.

- Compatible string matching for `hardware.deviceTree.overlays` has been changed to a more correct behavior. See [below](#sec-release-24.11-migration-dto-compatible) for details.

- The `rustic` package was upgrade to `0.9.0`, which contains [breaking changes to the config file format](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/releases/tag/v0.9.0).

- `pkgs.formats.ini` and `pkgs.formats.iniWithGlobalSection` with
  `listsAsDuplicateKeys` or `listToValue` no longer merge non-list values into
  lists by default. Backwards-compatible behavior can be enabled with
  `atomsCoercedToLists`.

- `openssl` now defaults to the latest version line `3.3.x`, instead of `3.0.x` before. While there should be no major code incompatibilities, newer OpenSSL versions typically strengthen the default security level. This means that you may have to explicitly allow weak ciphers, hashes and key lengths if necessary. See: [OpenSSL security level documentation](https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level/).

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-24.11-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The `zerocallusedregs` hardening flag is enabled by default on compilers that support it.

- The `stackclashprotection` hardening flag has been added, though disabled by default.

- The `pacret` hardening flag has been added, though disabled by default.

- `cargoSha256` in `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` has been deprecated in favor
  of `cargoHash` which supports SRI hashes. See
  [buildRustPackage: Compiling Rust applications with Cargo](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#compiling-rust-applications-with-cargo)
  for more information.

- The `vendorHash` of Go packages built with `buildGoModule` can now be overridden with `overrideAttrs`.
  `goModules`, `modRoot`, `vendorHash`, `deleteVendor`, and `proxyVendor` are now passed as derivation attributes.
  `goModules` and `vendorHash` are no longer placed under `passthru`.

- `buildFlags`/`buildFlagsArray` on `buildGoModule` have been deprecated. 24.11 is the last release where `buildGoModule` accepts these flags (while throwing a warning).
  Use the [`ldflags`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#var-go-ldflags) and/or [`tags`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#var-go-tags) attributes or
  [the environment](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#ssec-go-environment) instead.

- `buildGoPackage` has been deprecated. 24.11 is the last release with `buildGoPackage` available.

- `hareHook` has been added as the language framework for Hare. From now on, it,
  not the `hare` package, should be added to `nativeBuildInputs` when building
  Hare programs.

- [`lib.options.mkPackageOptionMD`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable#function-library-lib.options.mkPackageOptionMD) is now obsolete; use the identical [`lib.options.mkPackageOption`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable#function-library-lib.options.mkPackageOption) instead.

- `lib.misc.mapAttrsFlatten` is now formally deprecated and will be removed in future releases; use the identical [`lib.attrsets.mapAttrsToList`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable#function-library-lib.attrsets.mapAttrsToList) instead.

- Tailscale's `authKeyFile` can now have its corresponding parameters set through `config.services.tailscale.authKeyParameters`, allowing for non-ephemeral unsupervised deployment and more.
  See [Registering new nodes using OAuth credentials](https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/oauth-clients#registering-new-nodes-using-oauth-credentials) for the supported options.

- `nixosTests` now provide a working IPv6 setup for VLAN 1 by default.

- Kanidm can now be provisioned using the new [`services.kanidm.provision`] option, but requires using a patched version available via `pkgs.kanidm.withSecretProvisioning`.

- Kanidm previously had an incorrect systemd service type, causing dependent units with an `after` and `requires` directive to start before `kanidm*` finished startup. The module has now been updated in line with upstream recommendations.

- The kubelet configuration file can now be amended with arbitrary additional content using the `services.kubernetes.kubelet.extraConfig` option.

- The `services.seafile` module was updated to major version 11.
  - As part of this upgrade, the database backend will be migrated to MySQL.
    This process should be automatic, but in case of a botched migration,
    old sqlite files are not removed and can be used to manually migrate the database.
  - Additionally, the updated CSRF protection may prevent some users from logging in.
    Specific origin addresses can be whitelisted using the `services.seafile.seahubExtraConf` option
    (e.g. `services.seafile.seahubExtraConf = ''CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ["https://example.com"]'';`).
    Note that first solution of the [official FAQ answer](https://cloud.seatable.io/dtable/external-links/7b976c85f504491cbe8e/?tid=0000&vid=0000&row-id=BQhH-2HSQs68Nq2EW91DBA)
    is not allowed by the `services.nginx` module's config-checker.

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v30 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud30`). The installation logic is as follows:
  - If [`services.nextcloud.package`](#opt-services.nextcloud.package) is specified explicitly, this package will be installed (**recommended**)
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=24.05, `pkgs.nextcloud29` will be installed by default.
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=24.11, `pkgs.nextcloud30` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v28 (or older) to v30 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud29` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud29;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).

- To facilitate dependency injection, the `imgui` package now builds a static archive using vcpkg' CMake rules.
  The derivation now installs "impl" headers selectively instead of by a wildcard.
  Use `imgui.src` if you just want to access the unpacked sources.

- The new `boot.loader.systemd-boot.windows` option makes setting up dual-booting with Windows on a different drive easier

- Linux 4.19 has been removed because it will reach its end of life within the lifespan of 24.11

- Unprivileged access to the kernel syslog via `dmesg` is now restricted by default. Users wanting to keep an
  unrestricted access to it can set `boot.kernel.sysctl."kernel.dmesg_restrict" = false`.

- The `i18n.inputMethod` module introduces two new properties:
  `enable` and `type`, for declaring whether to enable an alternative input method and defining which input method respectfully. The options available in `type` are the same as the existing `enabled` option. `enabled` is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.

- `security.pam.u2f` now follows RFC42.
  All module options are now settable through the freeform `.settings`.

- Mikutter was removed because the package was broken and had no maintainers.

- Gollum was upgraded to major version 6. Read their [migration notes](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/6.0-Release-Notes).

- The hooks `yarnConfigHook` and `yarnBuildHook` were added. These should replace `yarn2nix.mkYarnPackage` and other `yarn2nix` related tools. The motivation to get rid of `yarn2nix` tools is the fact that they are too complex and hard to maintain, and they rely upon too much Nix evaluation which is problematic if import-from-derivation is not allowed (see more details at [#296856](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/296856). The transition from `mkYarnPackage` to `yarn{Config,Build}Hook` is tracked at [#324246](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/324246).

- `services.timesyncd.servers` now defaults to `null`, allowing systemd-timesyncd to use NTP servers advertised by DHCP.

- `services.timesyncd.fallbackServers` was added and defaults to `networking.timeServers`.

- Cinnamon has been updated to 6.2, please check [upstream announcement](https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_wilma_whatsnew.php) for more details.
  Following Mint 22 defaults, the Cinnamon module no longer ships geary and hexchat by default.

- `zfs.latestCompatibleLinuxPackages` is deprecated and is now pointing at the default kernel. If using the stable LTS kernel (default `linuxPackages` is not possible then you must explicitly pin a specific kernel release. For example, `boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_6_6`. Please be aware that non-LTS kernels are likely to go EOL before ZFS supports the latest supported non-LTS release, requiring manual intervention.

- The `shadowstack` hardening flag has been added, though disabled by default.

- `xxd` is now provided by the `tinyxxd` package, rather than `vim.xxd`, to reduce closure size and vulnerability impact. Since it has the same options and semantics as Vim's `xxd` utility, there is no user impact. Vim's `xxd` remains available as the `vim.xxd` package.

- `prometheus-openldap-exporter` was removed since it was unmaintained upstream and had no nixpkgs maintainers.

- `restic` module now has an option for inhibiting system sleep while backups are running, defaulting to off (not inhibiting sleep), available as [`services.restic.backups.<name>.inhibitsSleep`](#opt-services.restic.backups._name_.inhibitsSleep).

- The arguments from [](#opt-services.postgresql.initdbArgs) now get shell-escaped.

- `cargo-tauri.hook` was introduced to help users build [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) projects. It is meant to be used alongside
  `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` and Node hooks such as `npmConfigHook`, `pnpm.configHook`, and the new `yarnConfig`

- `power.ups` now powers off UPSs during a power outage event.
  This saves UPS battery and ensures that host(s) get back up again when power comes back, even in the scenario when the UPS would have had enough capacity to keep power on during the whole power outage.
  If you like the old behaviour of keeping the UPSs on (and emptying the battery) after the host(s) have shut down, and risk not getting a power cycle event to get the host(s) back up, set `power.ups.upsmon.settings.POWERDOWNFLAG = null;`.

- `nixos-firewall-tool` now supports nftables in addition to iptables and is installed by default when NixOS firewall is enabled.

- Support for *runner registration tokens* has been [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/380872)
  in `gitlab-runner` 15.6 and is expected to be removed in `gitlab-runner` 18.0. Configuration of existing runners
  should be changed to using *runner authentication tokens* by configuring
  {option}`services.gitlab-runner.services.<name>.authenticationTokenConfigFile` instead of the former
  {option}`services.gitlab-runner.services.<name>.registrationConfigFile` option.

- `iproute2` now has libbpf support.

- `nix.channel.enable = false` no longer implies `nix.settings.nix-path = []`.
  Since Nix 2.13, a `nix-path` set in `nix.conf` cannot be overridden by the `NIX_PATH` configuration variable.

- ZFS now imports its pools in `postResumeCommands` rather than `postDeviceCommands`. If you had `postDeviceCommands` scripts that depended on ZFS pools being imported, those now need to be in `postResumeCommands`.

- `services.automatic-timezoned.enable = true` will now set `time.timeZone = null`.
  This is to avoid silently shadowing a user's explicitly defined timezone without recognition on the user's part.

- `services.localtimed.enable = true` will now set `time.timeZone = null`.
  This is to avoid silently shadowing a user's explicitly defined timezone without recognition on the user's part.

## Detailed migration information {#sec-release-24.11-migration}

### `sound` options removal {#sec-release-24.11-migration-sound}

The `sound` options have been largely removed, as they are unnecessary for most modern setups, and cause issues when enabled.

If you set `sound.enable` in your configuration:
  - If you are using Pulseaudio or PipeWire, simply remove that option
  - If you are not using an external sound server, and want volumes to be persisted across shutdowns, set `hardware.alsa.enablePersistence = true` instead

If you set `sound.enableOSSEmulation` in your configuration:
  - Make sure it is still necessary, as very few applications actually use OSS
  - If necessary, set `boot.kernelModules = [ "snd_pcm_oss" ]`

If you set `sound.extraConfig` in your configuration:
  - If you are using another sound server, like Pulseaudio, JACK or PipeWire, migrate your configuration to that
  - If you are not using an external sound server, set `environment.etc."asound.conf".text = yourExtraConfig` instead

If you set `sound.mediaKeys` in your configuration:
  - Preferably switch to handling media keys in your desktop environment/compositor
  - If you want to maintain the exact behavior of the option, use the following snippet

```nix
services.actkbd = let
  volumeStep = "1%";
in {
  enable = true;
  bindings = [
    # "Mute" media key
    { keys = [ 113 ]; events = [ "key" ];       command = "${alsa-utils}/bin/amixer -q set Master toggle"; }

    # "Lower Volume" media key
    { keys = [ 114 ]; events = [ "key" "rep" ]; command = "${alsa-utils}/bin/amixer -q set Master ${volumeStep}- unmute"; }

    # "Raise Volume" media key
    { keys = [ 115 ]; events = [ "key" "rep" ]; command = "${alsa-utils}/bin/amixer -q set Master ${volumeStep}+ unmute"; }

    # "Mic Mute" media key
    { keys = [ 190 ]; events = [ "key" ];       command = "${alsa-utils}/bin/amixer -q set Capture toggle"; }
  ];
};
```

### `hardware.deviceTree.overlays` compatible string matching {#sec-release-24.11-migration-dto-compatible}

The original compatible string implementation in older NixOS versions relied on substring matching,
which is incorrect for overlays with multiple compatible strings and other cases.

The new behavior is consistent with what other tools already do - the overlay is considered applicable if,
and only if, _any_ of the compatible strings in the overlay match _any_ of the compatible strings in the DT.

To provide some examples:

| Overlay `compatible` | DT `compatible` | Pre-24.11 behavior | Correct behavior | Notes                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `"foo"`              | `"foo", "bar"`  | match              | match            | Most common use case does not change       |
| `"foo"`              | `"foobar"`      | match              | no match         | Substrings should not be matched           |
| `"foo bar"`          | `"foo", "bar"`  | match              | no match         | Separators should not be matched to spaces |
| `"foo", "bar"`       | `"baz", "bar"`  | no match           | match            | One compatible string matching is enough   |

Note that this also allows writing overlays that explicitly apply to multiple boards.
