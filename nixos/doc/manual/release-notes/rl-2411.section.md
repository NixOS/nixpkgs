- `nvimpager` was updated to version 0.13.0, which changes the order of user and
  nvimpager settings: user commands in `-c` and `--cmd` now override the
  respective default settings because they are executed later.

- Legacy package `stalwart-mail_0_6` was dropped, please note the
  [manual upgrade process](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server/blob/main/UPGRADING.md)
  before changing the package to `pkgs.stalwart-mail` in
  [`services.stalwart-mail.package`](#opt-services.stalwart-mail.package).
