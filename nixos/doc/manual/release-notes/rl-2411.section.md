# Release 24.11 (“Vicuña”, 2024.11/??) {#sec-release-24.11}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

## Highlights {#sec-release-24.11-highlights}

- [AMDVLK](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK), AMD's open source Vulkan driver, is now available to be configured as `hardware.amdgpu.amdvlk` option.
  This also allows configuring runtime settings of AMDVLK and enabling experimental features.

## New Services {#sec-release-24.11-new-services}

- [Open-WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), a user-friendly WebUI
  for LLMs. Available as [services.open-webui](#opt-services.open-webui.enable)
  service.

- [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io), sub-second search & analytics engine on cloud storage. Available as [services.quickwit](options.html#opt-services.quickwit).

- [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), a dependency updating tool for various git forges and language ecosystems. Available as [services.renovate](#opt-services.renovate.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-24.11-incompatibilities}

- `androidenv.androidPkgs_9_0` has been removed, and replaced with `androidenv.androidPkgs` for a more complete Android SDK including support for Android 9 and later.

- `nginx` package no longer includes `gd` and `geoip` dependencies. For enabling it, override `nginx` package with the optionals `withImageFilter` and `withGeoIP`.

- `openssh` and `openssh_hpn` are now compiled without Kerberos 5 / GSSAPI support in an effort to reduce the attack surface of the components for the majority of users. Users needing this support can
  use the new `opensshWithKerberos` and `openssh_hpnWithKerberos` flavors (e.g. `programs.ssh.package = pkgs.openssh_gssapi`).

- `nvimpager` was updated to version 0.13.0, which changes the order of user and
  nvimpager settings: user commands in `-c` and `--cmd` now override the
  respective default settings because they are executed later.

- `services.forgejo.mailerPasswordFile` has been deprecated by the drop-in replacement `services.forgejo.secrets.mailer.PASSWD`,
  which is part of the new free-form `services.forgejo.secrets` option.
  `services.forgejo.secrets` is a small wrapper over systemd's `LoadCredential=`. It has the same structure (sections/keys) as
  `services.forgejo.settings` but takes file paths that will be read before service startup instead of some plaintext value.

- `services.ddclient.use` has been deprecated: `ddclient` now supports separate IPv4 and IPv6 configuration. Use `services.ddclient.usev4` and `services.ddclient.usev6` instead.

- `vaultwarden` lost the capability to bind to privileged ports. If you rely on
   this behavior, override the systemd unit to allow `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` in
   your local configuration.

- The Invoiceplane module now only accepts the structured `settings` option.
  `extraConfig` is now removed.

- Legacy package `stalwart-mail_0_6` was dropped, please note the
  [manual upgrade process](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server/blob/main/UPGRADING.md)
  before changing the package to `pkgs.stalwart-mail` in
  [`services.stalwart-mail.package`](#opt-services.stalwart-mail.package).

- `haskell.lib.compose.justStaticExecutables` now disallows references to GHC in the
  output by default, to alert users to closure size issues caused by
  [#164630](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/164630). See ["Packaging
  Helpers" in the Haskell section of the Nixpkgs
  manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#haskell-packaging-helpers)
  for information on working around `output '...' is not allowed to refer to
  the following paths` errors caused by this change.

- The `stalwart-mail` module now uses RocksDB as the default storage backend
  for `stateVersion` ≥ 24.11. (It was previously using SQLite for structured
  data and the filesystem for blobs).

- `zx` was updated to v8, which introduces several breaking changes.
  See the [v8 changelog](https://github.com/google/zx/releases/tag/8.0.0) for more information.

- The `portunus` package and service do not support weak password hashes anymore.
  If you installed Portunus on NixOS 23.11 or earlier, upgrade to NixOS 24.05 first to get support for strong password hashing.
  Then, follow the instructions on the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/majewsky/portunus/releases/tag/v2.0.0) to upgrade all existing user accounts to strong password hashes.
  If you need to upgrade to 24.11 without having completed the migration, consider the security implications of weak password hashes on your user accounts, and add the following to your configuration:
  ```nix
  services.portunus.package      = pkgs.portunus.override { libxcrypt = pkgs.libxcrypt-legacy; };
  services.portunus.ldap.package = pkgs.openldap.override { libxcrypt = pkgs.libxcrypt-legacy; };
  ```

- The `tracy` package no longer works on X11, since it's moved to Wayland
  support, which is the intended default behavior by Tracy maintainers.
  X11 users have to switch to the new package `tracy-x11`.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-24.11-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `hareHook` has been added as the language framework for Hare. From now on, it,
  not the `hare` package, should be added to `nativeBuildInputs` when building
  Hare programs.

- To facilitate dependency injection, the `imgui` package now builds a static archive using vcpkg' CMake rules.
  The derivation now installs "impl" headers selectively instead of by a wildcard.
  Use `imgui.src` if you just want to access the unpacked sources.
