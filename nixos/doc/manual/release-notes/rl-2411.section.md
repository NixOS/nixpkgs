## Highlights {#sec-release-24.11-highlights}

## New Services {#sec-release-24.11-new-services}

- Create the first release note entry in this section!

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-24.11-incompatibilities}

- `nginx` package no longer includes `gd` and `geoip` dependencies. For enabling it, override `nginx` package with the optionals `withImageFilter` and `withGeoIP`.

- `openssh` and `openssh_hpn` are now compiled without Kerberos 5 / GSSAPI support in an effort to reduce the attack surface of the components for the majority of users. Users needing this support can
  use the new `opensshWithKerberos` and `openssh_hpnWithKerberos` flavors (e.g. `programs.ssh.package = pkgs.openssh_gssapi`).

- `nvimpager` was updated to version 0.13.0, which changes the order of user and
  nvimpager settings: user commands in `-c` and `--cmd` now override the
  respective default settings because they are executed later.

- Legacy package `stalwart-mail_0_6` was dropped, please note the
  [manual upgrade process](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server/blob/main/UPGRADING.md)
  before changing the package to `pkgs.stalwart-mail` in
  [`services.stalwart-mail.package`](#opt-services.stalwart-mail.package).
