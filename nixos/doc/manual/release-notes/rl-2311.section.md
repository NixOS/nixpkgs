## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.11-incompatibilities}

- The `boot.loader.raspberryPi` options have been marked deprecated, with intent for removal for NixOS 24.11. They had a limited use-case, and do not work like people expect. They required either very old installs ([before mid-2019](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/62462)) or customized builds out of scope of the standard and generic AArch64 support. That option set never supported the Raspberry Pi 4 family of devices.

- `python3.pkgs.sequoia` was removed in favor of `python3.pkgs.pysequoia`. The latter package is based on upstream's dedicated repository for sequoia's Python bindings, where the Python bindings from [gitlab:sequoia-pgp/sequoia](https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia) were removed long ago.

- `writeTextFile` now requires `executable` to be boolean, values like `null` or `""` will now fail to evaluate.

- The latest version of `clonehero` now stores custom content in `~/.clonehero`. See the [migration instructions](https://clonehero.net/2022/11/29/v23-to-v1-migration-instructions.html). Typically, these content files would exist along side the binary, but the previous build used a wrapper script that would store them in `~/.config/unity3d/srylain Inc_/Clone Hero`.

- The `services.hostapd` module was rewritten to support `passwordFile` like options, WPA3-SAE, and management of multiple interfaces. This breaks compatibility with older configurations.
  - `hostapd` is now started with additional systemd sandbox/hardening options for better security.
  - `services.hostapd.interface` was replaced with a per-radio and per-bss configuration scheme using [services.hostapd.radios](#opt-services.hostapd.radios).
  - `services.hostapd.wpa` has been replaced by [services.hostapd.radios.&lt;name&gt;.networks.&lt;name&gt;.authentication.wpaPassword](#opt-services.hostapd.radios._name_.networks._name_.authentication.wpaPassword) and [services.hostapd.radios.&lt;name&gt;.networks.&lt;name&gt;.authentication.saePasswords](#opt-services.hostapd.radios._name_.networks._name_.authentication.saePasswords) which configure WPA2-PSK and WP3-SAE respectively.
  - The default authentication has been changed to WPA3-SAE. Options for other (legacy) schemes are still available.

- `python3.pkgs.fetchPypi` (and `python3Packages.fetchPypi`) has been deprecated in favor of top-level `fetchPypi`.

- `mariadb` now defaults to `mariadb_1011` instead of `mariadb_106`, meaning the default version was upgraded from 10.6.x to 10.11.x. See the [upgrade notes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-6-to-mariadb-10-11/) for potential issues.

- `getent` has been moved from `glibc`'s `bin` output to its own dedicated output, reducing closure size for many dependents. Dependents using the `getent` alias should not be affected; others should move from using `glibc.bin` or `getBin glibc` to `getent` (which also improves compatibility with non-glibc platforms).

- The `services.ananicy.extraRules` option now has the type of `listOf attrs` instead of `string`.

- `etcd` has been updated to 3.5, you will want to read the [3.3 to 3.4](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_4/) and [3.4 to 3.5](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_5/) upgrade guides

- `consul` has been updated to `1.16.0`. See the [release note](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.16.0) for more details. Once a new Consul version has started and upgraded its data directory, it generally cannot be downgraded to the previous version.

- `himalaya` has been updated to `0.8.0`, which drops the native TLS support (in favor of Rustls) and add OAuth 2.0 support. See the [release note](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/releases/tag/v0.8.0) for more details.

- The [services.caddy.acmeCA](#opt-services.caddy.acmeCA) option now defaults to `null` instead of `"https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"`, to use all of Caddy's default ACME CAs and enable Caddy's automatic issuer fallback feature by default, as recommended by upstream.

- The default priorities of [`services.nextcloud.phpOptions`](#opt-services.nextcloud.phpOptions) have changed. This means that e.g.
  `services.nextcloud.phpOptions."opcache.interned_strings_buffer" = "23";` doesn't discard all of the other defaults from this option
  anymore. The attribute values of `phpOptions` are still defaults, these can be overridden as shown here.

  To override all of the options (including including `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`
  and `memory_limit` which all point to [`services.nextcloud.maxUploadSize`](#opt-services.nextcloud.maxUploadSize)
  by default) can be done like this:

  ```nix
  {
    services.nextcloud.phpOptions = lib.mkForce {
      /* ... */
    };
  }
  ```

- `php80` is no longer supported due to upstream not supporting this version anymore.

- PHP now defaults to PHP 8.2, updated from 8.1.

- The ISC DHCP package and corresponding module have been removed, because they are end of life upstream. See https://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-dhcp-eol/ for details and switch to a different DHCP implementation like kea or dnsmasq.

- `util-linux` is now supported on Darwin and is no longer an alias to `unixtools`. Use the `unixtools.util-linux` package for access to the Apple variants of the utilities.

- `services.keyd` changed API. Now you can create multiple configuration files.

- `services.ddclient` has been removed on the request of the upstream maintainer because it is unmaintained and has bugs. Please switch to a different software like `inadyn` or `knsupdate`.

- The `vlock` program from the `kbd` package has been moved into its own package output and should now be referenced explicitly as `kbd.vlock` or replaced with an alternative such as the standalone `vlock` package or `physlock`.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoFormat` now uses `systemd-makefs`, which does not accept formatting options. Therefore, `fileSystems.<name>.formatOptions` has been removed.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoResize` now uses `systemd-growfs` to resize the file system online in stage 2. This means that `f2fs` and `ext2` can no longer be auto resized, while `xfs` and `btrfs` now can be.

- The `services.vaultwarden.config` option default value was changed to make Vaultwarden only listen on localhost, following the [secure defaults for most NixOS services](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/100192).

- `services.lemmy.settings.federation` was removed in 0.17.0 and no longer has any effect. To enable federation, the hostname must be set in the configuration file and then federation must be enabled in the admin web UI. See the [release notes](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/c32585b03429f0f76d1e4ff738786321a0a9df98/RELEASES.md#upgrade-instructions) for more details.

- `pict-rs` was upgraded from 0.3 to 0.4 and contains an incompatible database & configuration change. To upgrade on systems with `stateVersion = "23.05";` or older follow the migration steps from https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#user-content-0-3-to-0-4-migration-guide and set `services.pict-rs.package = pkgs.pict-rs;`.

- The following packages in `haskellPackages` have now a separate bin output: `cabal-fmt`, `calligraphy`, `eventlog2html`, `ghc-debug-brick`, `hindent`, `nixfmt`, `releaser`. This means you need to replace e.g. `"${pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}/bin/nixfmt"` with `"${lib.getBin pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}/bin/nixfmt"` or `"${lib.getExe pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}"`. The binaries also won’t be in scope if you rely on them being installed e.g. via `ghcWithPackages`. `environment.packages` picks the `bin` output automatically, so for normal installation no intervention is required. Also, toplevel attributes like `pkgs.nixfmt` are not impacted negatively by this change.

- `spamassassin` no longer supports the `Hashcash` module. The module needs to be removed from the `loadplugin` list if it was copied over from the default `initPreConf` option.

- `services.outline.sequelizeArguments` has been removed, as `outline` no longer executes database migrations via the `sequelize` cli.

- The binary of the package `cloud-sql-proxy` has changed from `cloud_sql_proxy` to `cloud-sql-proxy`.

- The `woodpecker-*` CI packages have been updated to 1.0.0. This release is wildly incompatible with the 0.15.X versions that were previously packaged. Please read [upstream's documentation](https://woodpecker-ci.org/docs/next/migrations#100) to learn how to update your CI configurations.

- The Caddy module gained a new option named `services.caddy.enableReload` which is enabled by default. It allows reloading the service instead of restarting it, if only a config file has changed. This option must be disabled if you have turned off the [Caddy admin API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#admin). If you keep this option enabled, you should consider setting [`grace_period`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#grace-period) to a non-infinite value to prevent Caddy from delaying the reload indefinitely.

- mdraid support is now optional. This reduces initramfs size and prevents the potentially undesired automatic detection and activation of software RAID pools. It is disabled by default in new configurations (determined by `stateVersion`), but the appropriate settings will be generated by `nixos-generate-config` when installing to a software RAID device, so the standard installation procedure should be unaffected. If you have custom configs relying on mdraid, ensure that you use `stateVersion` correctly or set `boot.swraid.enable` manually.

- The `go-ethereum` package has been updated to v1.12.0. This drops support for proof-of-work. Its GraphQL API now encodes all numeric values as hex strings and the GraphQL UI is updated to version 2.0. The default database has changed from `leveldb` to `pebble` but `leveldb` can be forced with the --db.engine=leveldb flag. The `checkpoint-admin` command was [removed along with trusted checkpoints](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27147).

- The default `kops` version is now 1.27.0 and support for 1.24 and older has been dropped.

- `pharo` has been updated to latest stable (PharoVM 10.0.5), which is compatible with the latest stable and oldstable images (Pharo 10 and 11). The VM in question is the 64bit Spur. The 32bit version has been dropped due to lack of maintenance. The Cog VM has been deleted because it is severily outdated. Finally, the `pharo-launcher` package has been deleted because it was not compatible with the newer VM, and due to lack of maintenance.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.11-notable-changes}

- The Cinnamon module now enables XDG desktop integration by default. If you are experiencing collisions related to xdg-desktop-portal-gtk you can safely remove `xdg.portal.extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];` from your NixOS configuration.

- `fontconfig` now defaults to using greyscale antialiasing instead of subpixel antialiasing because of a [recommendation from one of the downstreams](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/-/issues/337). You can change this value by configuring [](#opt-fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba) accordingly.

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v27 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud27`). The installation logic is as follows:
  - If [`services.nextcloud.package`](#opt-services.nextcloud.package) is specified explicitly, this package will be installed (**recommended**)
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.11, `pkgs.nextcloud27` will be installed by default.
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.05, `pkgs.nextcloud26` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v25 (or older) to v27 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud26` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud26;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).

- New options were added to `services.searx` for better SearXNG support, including options for the built-in rate limiter and bot protection and automatically configuring a local redis server.

- A new option was added to the virtualisation module that enables specifying explicitly named network interfaces in QEMU VMs. The existing `virtualisation.vlans` is still supported for cases where the name of the network interface is irrelevant.

- DocBook option documentation is no longer supported, all module documentation now uses markdown.

- `buildGoModule` `go-modules` attrs have been renamed to `goModules`.

- The `fonts.fonts` and `fonts.enableDefaultFonts` options have been renamed to `fonts.packages` and `fonts.enableDefaultPackages` respectively.

- `services.fail2ban.jails` can now be configured with attribute sets defining settings and filters instead of lines. The stringed options `daemonConfig` and `extraSettings` have respectively been replaced by `daemonSettings` and `jails.DEFAULT.settings` which use attribute sets.

- The module [services.ankisyncd](#opt-services.ankisyncd.package) has been switched to [anki-sync-server-rs](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server-rs) from the old python version, which was difficult to update, had not been updated in a while, and did not support recent versions of anki.
Unfortunately all servers supporting new clients (newer version of anki-sync-server, anki's built in sync server and this new rust package) do not support the older sync protocol that was used in the old server, so such old clients will also need updating and in particular the anki package in nixpkgs is also being updated in this release.
The module update takes care of the new config syntax and the data itself (user login and cards) are compatible, so users of the module will be able to just log in again after updating both client and server without any extra action.

- `services.nginx` gained a `defaultListen` option at server-level with support for PROXY protocol listeners, also `proxyProtocol` is now exposed in `services.nginx.virtualHosts.<name>.listen` option. It is now possible to run PROXY listeners and non-PROXY listeners at a server-level, see [#213510](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/213510/) for more details.

- `services.prometheus.exporters` has a new exporter to monitor electrical power consumption based on PowercapRAPL sensor called [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre), see [#239803](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/239803) for more details.

- The module `services.calibre-server` has new options to configure the `host`, `port`, `auth.enable`, `auth.mode` and `auth.userDb` path, see [#216497](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/216497/) for more details.

- `services.prometheus.exporters` has a new [exporter](https://github.com/hipages/php-fpm_exporter) to monitor PHP-FPM processes, see [#240394](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/240394) for more details.

- `programs.gnupg.agent.pinentryFlavor` is now set in `/etc/gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`, and will no longer take precedence over a `pinentry-program` set in `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`.

- `wrapHelm` now exposes `passthru.pluginsDir` which can be passed to `helmfile`. For convenience, a top-level package `helmfile-wrapped` has been added, which inherits `passthru.pluginsDir` from `kubernetes-helm-wrapped`. See [#217768](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/217768) for details.

- `boot.initrd.network.udhcp.enable` allows control over dhcp during stage 1 regardless of what `networking.useDHCP` is set to.

- Suricata was upgraded from 6.0 to 7.0 and no longer considers HTTP/2 support as experimental, see [upstream release notes](https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-7-0-0-released/3715) for more details.

## Nixpkgs internals {#sec-release-23.11-nixpkgs-internals}

- The use of `sourceRoot = "source";`, `sourceRoot = "source/subdir";`, and similar lines in package derivations using the default `unpackPhase` is deprecated as it requires `unpackPhase` to always produce a directory named "source". Use `sourceRoot = src.name`, `sourceRoot = "${src.name}/subdir";`, or `setSourceRoot = "sourceRoot=$(echo */subdir)";` or similar instead.

- The `qemu-vm.nix` module by default now identifies block devices via
  persistent names available in `/dev/disk/by-*`. Because the rootDevice is
  identfied by its filesystem label, it needs to be formatted before the VM is
  started. The functionality of automatically formatting the rootDevice in the
  initrd is removed from the QEMU module. However, for tests that depend on
  this functionality, a test utility for the scripted initrd is added
  (`nixos/tests/common/auto-format-root-device.nix`). To use this in a NixOS
  test, import the module, e.g. `imports = [
  ./common/auto-format-root-device.nix ];` When you use the systemd initrd, you
  can automatically format the root device by setting
  `virtualisation.fileSystems."/".autoFormat = true;`.
