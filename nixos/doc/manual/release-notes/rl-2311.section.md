## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.11-incompatibilities}

- The latest version of `clonehero` now stores custom content in `~/.clonehero`. See the [migration instructions](https://clonehero.net/2022/11/29/v23-to-v1-migration-instructions.html). Typically, these content files would exist along side the binary, but the previous build used a wrapper script that would store them in `~/.config/unity3d/srylain Inc_/Clone Hero`.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.11-notable-changes}

- A new option was added to the virtualisation module that enables specifying explicitly named network interfaces in QEMU VMs. The existing `virtualisation.vlans` is still supported for cases where the name of the network interface is irrelevant.

- `services.nginx` gained a `defaultListen` option at server-level with support for PROXY protocol listeners, also `proxyProtocol` is now exposed in `services.nginx.virtualHosts.<name>.listen` option. It is now possible to run PROXY listeners and non-PROXY listeners at a server-level, see [#213510](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/213510/) for more details.
