## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.11-incompatibilities}

- `writeTextFile` now requires `executable` to be boolean, values like `null` or `""` will now fail to evaluate.

- The latest version of `clonehero` now stores custom content in `~/.clonehero`. See the [migration instructions](https://clonehero.net/2022/11/29/v23-to-v1-migration-instructions.html). Typically, these content files would exist along side the binary, but the previous build used a wrapper script that would store them in `~/.config/unity3d/srylain Inc_/Clone Hero`.

- `python3.pkgs.fetchPypi` (and `python3Packages.fetchPypi`) has been deprecated in favor of top-level `fetchPypi`.

- `mariadb` now defaults to `mariadb_1011` instead of `mariadb_106`, meaning the default version was upgraded from 10.6.x to 10.11.x. See the [upgrade notes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-6-to-mariadb-10-11/) for potential issues.

- `etcd` has been updated to 3.5, you will want to read the [3.3 to 3.4](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_4/) and [3.4 to 3.5](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_5/) upgrade guides

- `himalaya` has been updated to `0.8.0`, which drops the native TLS support (in favor of Rustls) and add OAuth 2.0 support. See the [release note](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/releases/tag/v0.8.0) for more details.

- The [services.caddy.acmeCA](#opt-services.caddy.acmeCA) option now defaults to `null` instead of `"https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"`, to use all of Caddy's default ACME CAs and enable Caddy's automatic issuer fallback feature by default, as recommended by upstream.

- `php80` is no longer supported due to upstream not supporting this version anymore.

- `util-linux` is now supported on Darwin and is no longer an alias to `unixtools`. Use the `unixtools.util-linux` package for access to the Apple variants of the utilities.

- The `vlock` program from the `kbd` package has been moved into its own package output and should now be referenced explicitly as `kbd.vlock` or replaced with an alternative such as the standalone `vlock` package or `physlock`.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoFormat` now uses `systemd-makefs`, which does not accept formatting options. Therefore, `fileSystems.<name>.formatOptions` has been removed.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoResize` now uses `systemd-growfs` to resize the file system online in stage 2. This means that `f2fs` and `ext2` can no longer be auto resized, while `xfs` and `btrfs` now can be.

- `services.lemmy.settings.federation` was removed in 0.17.0 and no longer has any effect. To enable federation, the hostname must be set in the configuration file and then federation must be enabled in the admin web UI. See the [release notes](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/c32585b03429f0f76d1e4ff738786321a0a9df98/RELEASES.md#upgrade-instructions) for more details.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.11-notable-changes}

- The Cinnamon module now enables XDG desktop integration by default. If you are experiencing collisions related to xdg-desktop-portal-gtk you can safely remove `xdg.portal.extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];` from your NixOS configuration.

- `fontconfig` now defaults to using greyscale antialiasing instead of subpixel antialiasing because of a [recommendation from one of the downstreams](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/-/issues/337). You can change this value by configuring [](#opt-fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba) accordingly.

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v27 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud27`). The installation logic is as follows:
  - If [`services.nextcloud.package`](#opt-services.nextcloud.package) is specified explicitly, this package will be installed (**recommended**)
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.11, `pkgs.nextcloud27` will be installed by default.
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.05, `pkgs.nextcloud26` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v25 (or older) to v27 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud26` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud26;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).

- A new option was added to the virtualisation module that enables specifying explicitly named network interfaces in QEMU VMs. The existing `virtualisation.vlans` is still supported for cases where the name of the network interface is irrelevant.

- DocBook option documentation is no longer supported, all module documentation now uses markdown.

- `services.nginx` gained a `defaultListen` option at server-level with support for PROXY protocol listeners, also `proxyProtocol` is now exposed in `services.nginx.virtualHosts.<name>.listen` option. It is now possible to run PROXY listeners and non-PROXY listeners at a server-level, see [#213510](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/213510/) for more details.

## Nixpkgs internals {#sec-release-23.11-nixpkgs-internals}

- The `qemu-vm.nix` module by default now identifies block devices via
  persistent names available in `/dev/disk/by-*`. Because the rootDevice is
  identfied by its filesystem label, it needs to be formatted before the VM is
  started. The functionality of automatically formatting the rootDevice in the
  initrd is removed from the QEMU module. However, for tests that depend on
  this functionality, a test utility for the scripted initrd is added
  (`nixos/tests/common/auto-format-root-device.nix`). To use this in a NixOS
  test, import the module, e.g. `imports = [
  ./common/auto-format-root-device.nix ];` When you use the systemd initrd, you
  can automatically format the root device by setting
  `virtualisation.fileSystems."/".autoFormat = true;`.
