## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.11-incompatibilities}

- The `boot.loader.raspberryPi` options have been marked deprecated, with intent for removal for NixOS 24.11. They had a limited use-case, and do not work like people expect. They required either very old installs ([before mid-2019](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/62462)) or customized builds out of scope of the standard and generic AArch64 support. That option set never supported the Raspberry Pi 4 family of devices.

- `python3.pkgs.sequoia` was removed in favor of `python3.pkgs.pysequoia`. The latter package is based on upstream's dedicated repository for sequoia's Python bindings, where the Python bindings from [gitlab:sequoia-pgp/sequoia](https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia) were removed long ago.

- `writeTextFile` now requires `executable` to be boolean, values like `null` or `""` will now fail to evaluate.

- The latest version of `clonehero` now stores custom content in `~/.clonehero`. See the [migration instructions](https://clonehero.net/2022/11/29/v23-to-v1-migration-instructions.html). Typically, these content files would exist along side the binary, but the previous build used a wrapper script that would store them in `~/.config/unity3d/srylain Inc_/Clone Hero`.

- The `services.hostapd` module was rewritten to support `passwordFile` like options, WPA3-SAE, and management of multiple interfaces. This breaks compatibility with older configurations.
  - `hostapd` is now started with additional systemd sandbox/hardening options for better security.
  - `services.hostapd.interface` was replaced with a per-radio and per-bss configuration scheme using [services.hostapd.radios](#opt-services.hostapd.radios).
  - `services.hostapd.wpa` has been replaced by [services.hostapd.radios.&lt;name&gt;.networks.&lt;name&gt;.authentication.wpaPassword](#opt-services.hostapd.radios._name_.networks._name_.authentication.wpaPassword) and [services.hostapd.radios.&lt;name&gt;.networks.&lt;name&gt;.authentication.saePasswords](#opt-services.hostapd.radios._name_.networks._name_.authentication.saePasswords) which configure WPA2-PSK and WP3-SAE respectively.
  - The default authentication has been changed to WPA3-SAE. Options for other (legacy) schemes are still available.

- `python3.pkgs.fetchPypi` (and `python3Packages.fetchPypi`) has been deprecated in favor of top-level `fetchPypi`.

- `pass` now does not contain `password-store.el`.  Users should get `password-store.el` from Emacs lisp package set `emacs.pkgs.password-store`.

- `mu` now does not install `mu4e` files by default.  Users should get `mu4e` from Emacs lisp package set `emacs.pkgs.mu4e`.

- `mariadb` now defaults to `mariadb_1011` instead of `mariadb_106`, meaning the default version was upgraded from 10.6.x to 10.11.x. See the [upgrade notes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-6-to-mariadb-10-11/) for potential issues.

- `getent` has been moved from `glibc`'s `bin` output to its own dedicated output, reducing closure size for many dependents. Dependents using the `getent` alias should not be affected; others should move from using `glibc.bin` or `getBin glibc` to `getent` (which also improves compatibility with non-glibc platforms).

- The `services.ananicy.extraRules` option now has the type of `listOf attrs` instead of `string`.

- JACK tools (`jack_*` except `jack_control`) have moved from the `jack2` package to `jack-example-tools`

- The `matrix-synapse` package & module have undergone some significant internal changes, for most setups no intervention is needed, though:
  - The option [`services.matrix-synapse.package`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.package) is now read-only. For modifying the package, use an overlay which modifies `matrix-synapse-unwrapped` instead. More on that below.
  - The `enableSystemd` & `enableRedis` arguments have been removed and `matrix-synapse` has been renamed to `matrix-synapse-unwrapped`. Also, several optional dependencies (such as `psycopg2` or `authlib`) have been removed.
  - These optional dependencies are automatically added via a wrapper (`pkgs.matrix-synapse.override { extras = ["redis"]; }` for `hiredis` & `txredisapi` for instance) if the relevant config section is declared in `services.matrix-synapse.settings`. For instance, if `services.matrix-synapse.settings.redis.enabled` is set to `true`, `"redis"` will be automatically added to the `extras` list of `pkgs.matrix-synapse`.
  - A list of all extras (and the extras enabled by default) can be found at the [option's reference for `services.matrix-synapse.extras`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.extras).
  - In some cases (e.g. for running synapse workers) it was necessary to re-use the `PYTHONPATH` of `matrix-synapse.service`'s environment to have all plugins available. This isn't necessary anymore, instead `config.services.matrix-synapse.package` can be used as it points to the wrapper with properly configured `extras` and also all plugins defined via [`services.matrix-synapse.plugins`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.plugins) available. This is also the reason for why the option is read-only now, it's supposed to be set by the module only.

- `etcd` has been updated to 3.5, you will want to read the [3.3 to 3.4](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_4/) and [3.4 to 3.5](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_5/) upgrade guides

- `gitlab` installations created or updated between versions \[15.11.0, 15.11.2] have an incorrect database schema. This will become a problem when upgrading to `gitlab` >=16.2.0. A workaround for affected users can be found in the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/versions/gitlab_16_changes.html#undefined-column-error-upgrading-to-162-or-later).

- `consul` has been updated to `1.16.0`. See the [release note](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.16.0) for more details. Once a new Consul version has started and upgraded its data directory, it generally cannot be downgraded to the previous version.

- `himalaya` has been updated to `0.8.0`, which drops the native TLS support (in favor of Rustls) and add OAuth 2.0 support. See the [release note](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/releases/tag/v0.8.0) for more details.

- The [services.caddy.acmeCA](#opt-services.caddy.acmeCA) option now defaults to `null` instead of `"https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"`, to use all of Caddy's default ACME CAs and enable Caddy's automatic issuer fallback feature by default, as recommended by upstream.

- The default priorities of [`services.nextcloud.phpOptions`](#opt-services.nextcloud.phpOptions) have changed. This means that e.g.
  `services.nextcloud.phpOptions."opcache.interned_strings_buffer" = "23";` doesn't discard all of the other defaults from this option
  anymore. The attribute values of `phpOptions` are still defaults, these can be overridden as shown here.

  To override all of the options (including including `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`
  and `memory_limit` which all point to [`services.nextcloud.maxUploadSize`](#opt-services.nextcloud.maxUploadSize)
  by default) can be done like this:

  ```nix
  {
    services.nextcloud.phpOptions = lib.mkForce {
      /* ... */
    };
  }
  ```

- `php80` is no longer supported due to upstream not supporting this version anymore.

- PHP now defaults to PHP 8.2, updated from 8.1.

- The ISC DHCP package and corresponding module have been removed, because they are end of life upstream. See https://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-dhcp-eol/ for details and switch to a different DHCP implementation like kea or dnsmasq.

- `prometheus-unbound-exporter` has been replaced by the Let's Encrypt maintained version, since the previous version was archived. This requires some changes to the module configuration, most notable `controlInterface` needs migration
   towards `unbound.host` and requires either the `tcp://` or `unix://` URI scheme.

- `odoo` now defaults to 16, updated from 15.

- `util-linux` is now supported on Darwin and is no longer an alias to `unixtools`. Use the `unixtools.util-linux` package for access to the Apple variants of the utilities.

- `services.keyd` changed API. Now you can create multiple configuration files.

- `baloo`, the file indexer/search engine used by KDE now has a patch to prevent files from constantly being reindexed when the device ids of the their underlying storage changes. This happens frequently when using btrfs or LVM. The patch has not yet been accepted upstream but it provides a significantly improved experience. When upgrading, reset baloo to get a clean index: `balooctl disable ; balooctl purge ; balooctl enable`.

- `services.ddclient` has been removed on the request of the upstream maintainer because it is unmaintained and has bugs. Please switch to a different software like `inadyn` or `knsupdate`.

- The `vlock` program from the `kbd` package has been moved into its own package output and should now be referenced explicitly as `kbd.vlock` or replaced with an alternative such as the standalone `vlock` package or `physlock`.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoFormat` now uses `systemd-makefs`, which does not accept formatting options. Therefore, `fileSystems.<name>.formatOptions` has been removed.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoResize` now uses `systemd-growfs` to resize the file system online in stage 2. This means that `f2fs` and `ext2` can no longer be auto resized, while `xfs` and `btrfs` now can be.

- The `services.vaultwarden.config` option default value was changed to make Vaultwarden only listen on localhost, following the [secure defaults for most NixOS services](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/100192).

- `services.lemmy.settings.federation` was removed in 0.17.0 and no longer has any effect. To enable federation, the hostname must be set in the configuration file and then federation must be enabled in the admin web UI. See the [release notes](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/c32585b03429f0f76d1e4ff738786321a0a9df98/RELEASES.md#upgrade-instructions) for more details.

- `pict-rs` was upgraded from 0.3 to 0.4 and contains an incompatible database & configuration change. To upgrade on systems with `stateVersion = "23.05";` or older follow the migration steps from https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#user-content-0-3-to-0-4-migration-guide and set `services.pict-rs.package = pkgs.pict-rs;`.

- The following packages in `haskellPackages` have now a separate bin output: `cabal-fmt`, `calligraphy`, `eventlog2html`, `ghc-debug-brick`, `hindent`, `nixfmt`, `releaser`. This means you need to replace e.g. `"${pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}/bin/nixfmt"` with `"${lib.getBin pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}/bin/nixfmt"` or `"${lib.getExe pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}"`. The binaries also won’t be in scope if you rely on them being installed e.g. via `ghcWithPackages`. `environment.packages` picks the `bin` output automatically, so for normal installation no intervention is required. Also, toplevel attributes like `pkgs.nixfmt` are not impacted negatively by this change.

- `spamassassin` no longer supports the `Hashcash` module. The module needs to be removed from the `loadplugin` list if it was copied over from the default `initPreConf` option.

- `services.outline.sequelizeArguments` has been removed, as `outline` no longer executes database migrations via the `sequelize` cli.

- The binary of the package `cloud-sql-proxy` has changed from `cloud_sql_proxy` to `cloud-sql-proxy`.

- The `woodpecker-*` CI packages have been updated to 1.0.0. This release is wildly incompatible with the 0.15.X versions that were previously packaged. Please read [upstream's documentation](https://woodpecker-ci.org/docs/next/migrations#100) to learn how to update your CI configurations.

- The Caddy module gained a new option named `services.caddy.enableReload` which is enabled by default. It allows reloading the service instead of restarting it, if only a config file has changed. This option must be disabled if you have turned off the [Caddy admin API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#admin). If you keep this option enabled, you should consider setting [`grace_period`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#grace-period) to a non-infinite value to prevent Caddy from delaying the reload indefinitely.

- mdraid support is now optional. This reduces initramfs size and prevents the potentially undesired automatic detection and activation of software RAID pools. It is disabled by default in new configurations (determined by `stateVersion`), but the appropriate settings will be generated by `nixos-generate-config` when installing to a software RAID device, so the standard installation procedure should be unaffected. If you have custom configs relying on mdraid, ensure that you use `stateVersion` correctly or set `boot.swraid.enable` manually.

- The `go-ethereum` package has been updated to v1.12.0. This drops support for proof-of-work. Its GraphQL API now encodes all numeric values as hex strings and the GraphQL UI is updated to version 2.0. The default database has changed from `leveldb` to `pebble` but `leveldb` can be forced with the --db.engine=leveldb flag. The `checkpoint-admin` command was [removed along with trusted checkpoints](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27147).

- The `aseprite-unfree` package has been upgraded from 1.2.16.3 to 1.2.40. The free version of aseprite has been dropped because it is EOL and the package attribute now points to the unfree version. A maintained fork of the last free version of Aseprite, named 'LibreSprite', is available in the `libresprite` package.

- The default `kops` version is now 1.27.0 and support for 1.24 and older has been dropped.

- `pharo` has been updated to latest stable (PharoVM 10.0.5), which is compatible with the latest stable and oldstable images (Pharo 10 and 11). The VM in question is the 64bit Spur. The 32bit version has been dropped due to lack of maintenance. The Cog VM has been deleted because it is severily outdated. Finally, the `pharo-launcher` package has been deleted because it was not compatible with the newer VM, and due to lack of maintenance.

- Emacs mainline version 29 was introduced. This new version includes many major additions, most notably `tree-sitter` support (enabled by default) and the pgtk variant (useful for Wayland users), which is available under the attribute `emacs29-pgtk`.

- Emacs macport version 29 was introduced.

- The `html-proofer` package has been updated from major version 3 to major version 5, which includes [breaking changes](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/blob/v5.0.8/UPGRADING.md).

- `kratos` has been updated from 0.10.1 to the first stable version 1.0.0, please read the [0.10.1 to 0.11.0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v0.11.0), [0.11.0 to 0.11.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v0.11.1), [0.11.1 to 0.13.0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v0.13.0) and [0.13.0 to 1.0.0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v1.0.0) upgrade guides. The most notable breaking change is the introduction of one-time passwords (`code`) and update of the default recovery strategy from `link` to `code`.

- The `hail` NixOS module was removed, as `hail` was unmaintained since 2017.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.11-notable-changes}

- The Cinnamon module now enables XDG desktop integration by default. If you are experiencing collisions related to xdg-desktop-portal-gtk you can safely remove `xdg.portal.extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];` from your NixOS configuration.

- GNOME, Pantheon, Cinnamon module no longer forces Qt applications to use Adwaita style since it was buggy and is no longer maintained upstream (specifically, Cinnamon now defaults to the gtk2 style instead, following the default in Linux Mint). If you still want it, you can add the following options to your configuration but it will probably be eventually removed:

  ```nix
  qt = {
    enable = true;
    platformTheme = "gnome";
    style = "adwaita";
  };
  ```

- `fontconfig` now defaults to using greyscale antialiasing instead of subpixel antialiasing because of a [recommendation from one of the downstreams](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/-/issues/337). You can change this value by configuring [](#opt-fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba) accordingly.

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v27 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud27`). The installation logic is as follows:
  - If [`services.nextcloud.package`](#opt-services.nextcloud.package) is specified explicitly, this package will be installed (**recommended**)
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.11, `pkgs.nextcloud27` will be installed by default.
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.05, `pkgs.nextcloud26` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v25 (or older) to v27 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud26` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud26;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).

- New options were added to `services.searx` for better SearXNG support, including options for the built-in rate limiter and bot protection and automatically configuring a local redis server.

- A new option was added to the virtualisation module that enables specifying explicitly named network interfaces in QEMU VMs. The existing `virtualisation.vlans` is still supported for cases where the name of the network interface is irrelevant.

- DocBook option documentation is no longer supported, all module documentation now uses markdown.

- `buildGoModule` `go-modules` attrs have been renamed to `goModules`.

- The `fonts.fonts` and `fonts.enableDefaultFonts` options have been renamed to `fonts.packages` and `fonts.enableDefaultPackages` respectively.

- `services.fail2ban.jails` can now be configured with attribute sets defining settings and filters instead of lines. The stringed options `daemonConfig` and `extraSettings` have respectively been replaced by `daemonSettings` and `jails.DEFAULT.settings` which use attribute sets.

- The application firewall `opensnitch` now uses the process monitor method eBPF as default as recommended by upstream. The method can be changed with the setting [services.opensnitch.settings.ProcMonitorMethod](#opt-services.opensnitch.settings.ProcMonitorMethod).

- The module [services.ankisyncd](#opt-services.ankisyncd.package) has been switched to [anki-sync-server-rs](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server-rs) from the old python version, which was difficult to update, had not been updated in a while, and did not support recent versions of anki.
Unfortunately all servers supporting new clients (newer version of anki-sync-server, anki's built in sync server and this new rust package) do not support the older sync protocol that was used in the old server, so such old clients will also need updating and in particular the anki package in nixpkgs is also being updated in this release.
The module update takes care of the new config syntax and the data itself (user login and cards) are compatible, so users of the module will be able to just log in again after updating both client and server without any extra action.

- `services.nginx` gained a `defaultListen` option at server-level with support for PROXY protocol listeners, also `proxyProtocol` is now exposed in `services.nginx.virtualHosts.<name>.listen` option. It is now possible to run PROXY listeners and non-PROXY listeners at a server-level, see [#213510](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/213510/) for more details.

- `services.restic.backups` now adds wrapper scripts to your system path, which set the same environment variables as the service, so restic operations can easly be run from the command line. This behavior can be disabled by setting `createWrapper` to `false`, per backup configuration.

- `services.prometheus.exporters` has a new exporter to monitor electrical power consumption based on PowercapRAPL sensor called [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre), see [#239803](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/239803) for more details.

- The MariaDB C client library was upgraded from 3.2.x to 3.3.x. It is recomended to review the [upstream release notes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-connector-c-33-release-notes/).

- The module `services.calibre-server` has new options to configure the `host`, `port`, `auth.enable`, `auth.mode` and `auth.userDb` path, see [#216497](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/216497/) for more details.

- `services.prometheus.exporters` has a new [exporter](https://github.com/hipages/php-fpm_exporter) to monitor PHP-FPM processes, see [#240394](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/240394) for more details.

- `services.github-runner` / `services.github-runners.<name>` gained the option `nodeRuntimes`. The option defaults to `[ "node20" ]`, i.e., the service supports Node.js 20 GitHub Actions only. The list of Node.js versions accepted by `nodeRuntimes` tracks the versions the upstream GitHub Actions runner supports. See [#249103](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/249103) for details.

- `programs.gnupg.agent.pinentryFlavor` is now set in `/etc/gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`, and will no longer take precedence over a `pinentry-program` set in `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`.

- `services.influxdb2` now supports doing an automatic initial setup and provisioning of users, organizations, buckets and authentication tokens, see [#249502](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/249502) for more details.

- `wrapHelm` now exposes `passthru.pluginsDir` which can be passed to `helmfile`. For convenience, a top-level package `helmfile-wrapped` has been added, which inherits `passthru.pluginsDir` from `kubernetes-helm-wrapped`. See [#217768](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/217768) for details.

- `boot.initrd.network.udhcp.enable` allows control over dhcp during stage 1 regardless of what `networking.useDHCP` is set to.

- Suricata was upgraded from 6.0 to 7.0 and no longer considers HTTP/2 support as experimental, see [upstream release notes](https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-7-0-0-released/3715) for more details.

- `networking.nftables` now has the option `networking.nftables.table.<table>` to create tables
  and have them be updated atomically, instead of flushing the ruleset.

- `networking.nftables` is no longer flushing all rulesets on every reload.
  Use `networking.nftables.flushRuleset = true;` to get back the old behaviour.

- The `cawbird` package is dropped from nixpkgs, as it got broken by the Twitter API closing down and has been abandoned upstream.

- Certificate generation via the `security.acme` now limits the concurrent number of running certificate renewals and generation jobs, to avoid spiking resource usage when processing many certificates at once. The limit defaults to *5* and can be adjusted via `maxConcurrentRenewals`. Setting it to *0* disables the limits altogether.

- New `boot.bcache.enable` (default enabled) allows completely removing `bcache` mount support.

## Nixpkgs internals {#sec-release-23.11-nixpkgs-internals}

- The use of `sourceRoot = "source";`, `sourceRoot = "source/subdir";`, and similar lines in package derivations using the default `unpackPhase` is deprecated as it requires `unpackPhase` to always produce a directory named "source". Use `sourceRoot = src.name`, `sourceRoot = "${src.name}/subdir";`, or `setSourceRoot = "sourceRoot=$(echo */subdir)";` or similar instead.

- The `django` alias in the python package set was upgraded to Django 4.x.
  Applications that consume Django should always pin their python environment
  to a compatible major version, so they can move at their own pace.

  ```nix
  python = python3.override {
    packageOverrides = self: super: {
      django = super.django_3;
    };
  };
  ```

- The `qemu-vm.nix` module by default now identifies block devices via
  persistent names available in `/dev/disk/by-*`. Because the rootDevice is
  identfied by its filesystem label, it needs to be formatted before the VM is
  started. The functionality of automatically formatting the rootDevice in the
  initrd is removed from the QEMU module. However, for tests that depend on
  this functionality, a test utility for the scripted initrd is added
  (`nixos/tests/common/auto-format-root-device.nix`). To use this in a NixOS
  test, import the module, e.g. `imports = [
  ./common/auto-format-root-device.nix ];` When you use the systemd initrd, you
  can automatically format the root device by setting
  `virtualisation.fileSystems."/".autoFormat = true;`.

- The `electron` packages now places its application files in `$out/libexec/electron` instead of `$out/lib/electron`. Packages using electron-builder will fail to build and need to be adjusted by changing `lib` to `libexec`.
