## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.11-incompatibilities}

- `writeTextFile` now requires `executable` to be boolean, values like `null` or `""` will now fail to evaluate.

- The latest version of `clonehero` now stores custom content in `~/.clonehero`. See the [migration instructions](https://clonehero.net/2022/11/29/v23-to-v1-migration-instructions.html). Typically, these content files would exist along side the binary, but the previous build used a wrapper script that would store them in `~/.config/unity3d/srylain Inc_/Clone Hero`.

- `python3.pkgs.fetchPypi` (and `python3Packages.fetchPypi`) has been deprecated in favor of top-level `fetchPypi`.

- `etcd` has been updated to 3.5, you will want to read the [3.3 to 3.4](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_4/) and [3.4 to 3.5](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_5/) upgrade guides

- `util-linux` is now supported on Darwin and is no longer an alias to `unixtools`. Use the `unixtools.util-linux` package for access to the Apple variants of the utilities.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.11-notable-changes}

- The Cinnamon module now enables XDG desktop integration by default. If you are experiencing collisions related to xdg-desktop-portal-gtk you can safely remove `xdg.portal.extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];` from your NixOS configuration.

- A new option was added to the virtualisation module that enables specifying explicitly named network interfaces in QEMU VMs. The existing `virtualisation.vlans` is still supported for cases where the name of the network interface is irrelevant.

- `services.nginx` gained a `defaultListen` option at server-level with support for PROXY protocol listeners, also `proxyProtocol` is now exposed in `services.nginx.virtualHosts.<name>.listen` option. It is now possible to run PROXY listeners and non-PROXY listeners at a server-level, see [#213510](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/213510/) for more details.
