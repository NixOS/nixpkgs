# Release 23.11 (“Tapir”, 2023.11/??) {#sec-release-23.11}

## Highlights {#sec-release-23.11-highlights}

- FoundationDB now defaults to major version 7.

- PostgreSQL now defaults to major version 15.

- Support for WiFi6 (IEEE 802.11ax) and WPA3-SAE-PK was enabled in the `hostapd` package, along with a significant rework of the hostapd module.

- LXD now supports virtual machine instances to complement the existing container support

- The `nixos-rebuild` command has been given a `list-generations` subcommand. See `man nixos-rebuild` for more details.

- [systemd](https://systemd.io) has been updated from v253 to v254, see [the release notes](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/v254/NEWS#L3-L659) for more information on the changes.
    - `boot.resumeDevice` **must be specified** when hibernating if not in EFI mode.
    - systemd may warn your system about the permissions of your ESP partition (often `/boot`), this warning can be ignored for now, we are looking
      into a satisfying solution regarding this problem.
    - Updating with `nixos-rebuild boot` and rebooting is recommended, since in some rare cases the `nixos-rebuild switch` into the new generation on a live system might fail due to missing mount units.

- [`sudo-rs`], a reimplementation of `sudo` in Rust, is now supported.
  An experimental new module `security.sudo-rs` was added.
  Switching to it (via `security.sudo.enable = false; security.sudo-rs.enable = true;`) introduces
  slight changes in sudo behaviour, due to `sudo-rs`' current limitations:
  - terminfo-related environment variables aren't preserved for `root` and `wheel`;
  - `root` and `wheel` are not given the ability to set (or preserve)
    arbitrary environment variables.

- [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) has been updated from version 2.37 to 2.38, see [the release notes](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Release/2.38) for what was changed.

[`sudo-rs`]: https://github.com/memorysafety/sudo-rs/

- `linuxPackages_testing_bcachefs` is now soft-deprecated by `linuxPackages_testing`.
  - Please consider changing your NixOS configuration's `boot.kernelPackages` to `linuxPackages_testing` until a stable kernel with bcachefs support is released.

- All [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/) packages have been updated to 5.7.0.
  - [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/) package attribute sets are versioned: `rocmPackages` -> `rocmPackages_5`.

- `yarn-berry` has been updated to 4.0.1. This means that NodeJS versions less than `18.12` are no longer supported by it. More details at the [upstream changelog](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

- If the user has a custom shell enabled via `users.users.${USERNAME}.shell = ${CUSTOMSHELL}`, the
  assertion will require them to also set `programs.${CUSTOMSHELL}.enable =
  true`. This is generally safe behavior, but for anyone needing to opt out from
  the check `users.users.${USERNAME}.ignoreShellProgramCheck = true` will do the job.

- Cassandra now defaults to 4.x, updated from 3.11.x.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.11-incompatibilities}

- `services.postgresql.ensurePermissions` has been deprecated in favor of `services.postgresql.ensureUsers.*.ensureDBOwnership` which simplifies the setup of database owned by a certain system user
  in local database contexts (which make use of peer authentication via UNIX sockets), migration guidelines were provided in the NixOS manual, please refer to them if you are affected by a PostgreSQL 15 changing the way `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES` is working. `services.postgresql.ensurePermissions` will be removed in 24.05. All NixOS modules were migrated using one of the strategy, e.g. `ensureDBOwnership` or `postStart`. More about this situation can be learnt in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/266270.

- `network-online.target` has been fixed to no longer time out for systems with `networking.useDHCP = true` and `networking.useNetworkd = true`.
  Workarounds for this can be removed.

- The `boot.loader.raspberryPi` options have been marked deprecated, with intent for removal for NixOS 24.11. They had a limited use-case, and do not work like people expect. They required either very old installs ([before mid-2019](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/62462)) or customized builds out of scope of the standard and generic AArch64 support. That option set never supported the Raspberry Pi 4 family of devices.

- `python3.pkgs.sequoia` was removed in favor of `python3.pkgs.pysequoia`. The latter package is based on upstream's dedicated repository for sequoia's Python bindings, where the Python bindings from [gitlab:sequoia-pgp/sequoia](https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia) were removed long ago.

- `writeTextFile` now requires `executable` to be boolean, values like `null` or `""` will now fail to evaluate.

- The latest version of `clonehero` now stores custom content in `~/.clonehero`. See the [migration instructions](https://clonehero.net/2022/11/29/v23-to-v1-migration-instructions.html). Typically, these content files would exist along side the binary, but the previous build used a wrapper script that would store them in `~/.config/unity3d/srylain Inc_/Clone Hero`.

- `services.mastodon` doesn't support providing a TCP port to its `streaming` component anymore, as upstream implemented parallelization by running multiple instances instead of running multiple processes in one instance. Please create a PR if you are interested in this feature.

- The `services.hostapd` module was rewritten to support `passwordFile` like options, WPA3-SAE, and management of multiple interfaces. This breaks compatibility with older configurations.
  - `hostapd` is now started with additional systemd sandbox/hardening options for better security.
  - `services.hostapd.interface` was replaced with a per-radio and per-bss configuration scheme using [services.hostapd.radios](#opt-services.hostapd.radios).
  - `services.hostapd.wpa` has been replaced by [services.hostapd.radios.&lt;name&gt;.networks.&lt;name&gt;.authentication.wpaPassword](#opt-services.hostapd.radios._name_.networks._name_.authentication.wpaPassword) and [services.hostapd.radios.&lt;name&gt;.networks.&lt;name&gt;.authentication.saePasswords](#opt-services.hostapd.radios._name_.networks._name_.authentication.saePasswords) which configure WPA2-PSK and WP3-SAE respectively.
  - The default authentication has been changed to WPA3-SAE. Options for other (legacy) schemes are still available.

- `python3.pkgs.fetchPypi` (and `python3Packages.fetchPypi`) has been deprecated in favor of top-level `fetchPypi`.

- `pass` now does not contain `password-store.el`.  Users should get `password-store.el` from Emacs lisp package set `emacs.pkgs.password-store`.

- `services.knot` now supports `.settings` from RFC42.  The previous `.extraConfig` still works the same, but it displays a warning now.

- `mu` now does not install `mu4e` files by default.  Users should get `mu4e` from Emacs lisp package set `emacs.pkgs.mu4e`.

- `mariadb` now defaults to `mariadb_1011` instead of `mariadb_106`, meaning the default version was upgraded from 10.6.x to 10.11.x. See the [upgrade notes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-6-to-mariadb-10-11/) for potential issues.

- `getent` has been moved from `glibc`'s `bin` output to its own dedicated output, reducing closure size for many dependents. Dependents using the `getent` alias should not be affected; others should move from using `glibc.bin` or `getBin glibc` to `getent` (which also improves compatibility with non-glibc platforms).

- `maintainers/scripts/update-luarocks-packages` is now a proper package
  `luarocks-packages-updater` that can be run to maintain out-of-tree luarocks
  packages

- The `users.users.<name>.passwordFile` has been renamed to `users.users.<name>.hashedPasswordFile` to avoid possible confusions. The option is in fact the file-based version of `hashedPassword`, not `password`, and expects a file containing the {manpage}`crypt(3)` hash of the user password.

- `chromiumBeta` and `chromiumDev` have been removed due to the lack of maintenance in nixpkgs. Consider using `chromium` instead.

- `google-chrome-beta` and `google-chrome-dev` have been removed due to the lack of maintenance in nixpkgs. Consider using `google-chrome` instead.

- The `services.ananicy.extraRules` option now has the type of `listOf attrs` instead of `string`.

- `buildVimPluginFrom2Nix` has been renamed to `buildVimPlugin`, which now
  now skips `configurePhase` and `buildPhase`

- JACK tools (`jack_*` except `jack_control`) have moved from the `jack2` package to `jack-example-tools`

- The `waagent` service does provisioning now

- The `matrix-synapse` package & module have undergone some significant internal changes, for most setups no intervention is needed, though:
  - The option [`services.matrix-synapse.package`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.package) is now read-only. For modifying the package, use an overlay which modifies `matrix-synapse-unwrapped` instead. More on that below.
  - The `enableSystemd` & `enableRedis` arguments have been removed and `matrix-synapse` has been renamed to `matrix-synapse-unwrapped`. Also, several optional dependencies (such as `psycopg2` or `authlib`) have been removed.
  - These optional dependencies are automatically added via a wrapper (`pkgs.matrix-synapse.override { extras = ["redis"]; }` for `hiredis` & `txredisapi` for instance) if the relevant config section is declared in `services.matrix-synapse.settings`. For instance, if `services.matrix-synapse.settings.redis.enabled` is set to `true`, `"redis"` will be automatically added to the `extras` list of `pkgs.matrix-synapse`.
  - A list of all extras (and the extras enabled by default) can be found at the [option's reference for `services.matrix-synapse.extras`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.extras).
  - In some cases (e.g. for running synapse workers) it was necessary to re-use the `PYTHONPATH` of `matrix-synapse.service`'s environment to have all plugins available. This isn't necessary anymore, instead `config.services.matrix-synapse.package` can be used as it points to the wrapper with properly configured `extras` and also all plugins defined via [`services.matrix-synapse.plugins`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.plugins) available. This is also the reason for why the option is read-only now, it's supposed to be set by the module only.

- `netbox` was updated to 3.6. NixOS' `services.netbox.package` still defaults to 3.5 if `stateVersion` is earlier than 23.11. Please review upstream's breaking changes [for 3.6.0](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v3.6.0) and upgrade NetBox by changing `services.netbox.package`. Database migrations will be run automatically.

- `etcd` has been updated to 3.5, you will want to read the [3.3 to 3.4](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_4/) and [3.4 to 3.5](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_5/) upgrade guides

- `gitlab` installations created or updated between versions \[15.11.0, 15.11.2] have an incorrect database schema. This will become a problem when upgrading to `gitlab` >=16.2.0. A workaround for affected users can be found in the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/versions/gitlab_16_changes.html#undefined-column-error-upgrading-to-162-or-later).

- `consul` has been updated to `1.16.0`. See the [release note](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.16.0) for more details. Once a new Consul version has started and upgraded its data directory, it generally cannot be downgraded to the previous version.

- `llvmPackages_rocm` has been moved to `rocmPackages.llvm`.

- `hip`, `rocm-opencl-runtime`, `rocm-opencl-icd`, and `rocclr` have been combined into `rocmPackages.clr`.

- `clang-ocl`, `clr`, `composable_kernel`, `hipblas`, `hipcc`, `hip-common`, `hipcub`,
  `hipfft`, `hipfort`, `hipify`, `hipsolver`, `hipsparse`, `migraphx`, `miopen`, `miopengemm`,
  `rccl`, `rdc`, `rocalution`, `rocblas`, `rocdgbapi`, `rocfft`, `rocgdb`, `rocm-cmake`,
  `rocm-comgr`, `rocm-core`, `rocm-device-libs`, `rocminfo`, `rocmlir`, `rocm-runtime`,
  `rocm-smi`, `rocm-thunk`, `rocprim`, `rocprofiler`, `rocrand`, `rocr-debug-agent`,
  `rocsolver`, `rocsparse`, `rocthrust`, `roctracer`, `rocwmma`, and `tensile` have been moved to `rocmPackages`.

- `himalaya` has been updated to `0.8.0`, which drops the native TLS support (in favor of Rustls) and add OAuth 2.0 support. See the [release note](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/releases/tag/v0.8.0) for more details.

- `nix-prefetch-git` now ignores global and user git config, to improve reproducibility.

- The [services.caddy.acmeCA](#opt-services.caddy.acmeCA) option now defaults to `null` instead of `"https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"`, to use all of Caddy's default ACME CAs and enable Caddy's automatic issuer fallback feature by default, as recommended by upstream.

- The default priorities of [`services.nextcloud.phpOptions`](#opt-services.nextcloud.phpOptions) have changed. This means that e.g.
  `services.nextcloud.phpOptions."opcache.interned_strings_buffer" = "23";` doesn't discard all of the other defaults from this option
  anymore. The attribute values of `phpOptions` are still defaults, these can be overridden as shown here.

  To override all of the options (including including `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`
  and `memory_limit` which all point to [`services.nextcloud.maxUploadSize`](#opt-services.nextcloud.maxUploadSize)
  by default) can be done like this:

  ```nix
  {
    services.nextcloud.phpOptions = lib.mkForce {
      /* ... */
    };
  }
  ```

- `php80` is no longer supported due to upstream not supporting this version anymore.

- PHP now defaults to PHP 8.2, updated from 8.1.

- GraalVM has been updated to the latest version, and this brings significant changes. Upstream don't release multiple versions targeting different JVMs anymore, so now we only have one GraalVM derivation (`graalvm-ce`). While at first glance the version may seem a downgrade (22.3.1 -> 21.0.0), the major version is now following the JVM it targets (so this latest version targets JVM 21). Also some products like `llvm-installable-svm` and `native-image-svm` were incorporate to the main GraalVM derivation, so they're included by default.

- GraalPy (`graalCEPackages.graalpy`), TruffleRuby (`graalCEPackages.truffleruby`), GraalJS (`graalCEPackages.graaljs`) and GraalNodeJS (`grallCEPackages.graalnodejs`) are now indepedent from the main GraalVM derivation.

- The ISC DHCP package and corresponding module have been removed, because they are end of life upstream. See https://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-dhcp-eol/ for details and switch to a different DHCP implementation like kea or dnsmasq.

- `prometheus-unbound-exporter` has been replaced by the Let's Encrypt maintained version, since the previous version was archived. This requires some changes to the module configuration, most notable `controlInterface` needs migration
   towards `unbound.host` and requires either the `tcp://` or `unix://` URI scheme.

- `odoo` now defaults to 16, updated from 15.

- `varnish` was upgraded from 7.2.x to 7.4.x, see https://varnish-cache.org/docs/7.3/whats-new/upgrading-7.3.html and https://varnish-cache.org/docs/7.4/whats-new/upgrading-7.4.html for upgrade notes. The current LTS version is still offered as `varnish60`.

- `util-linux` is now supported on Darwin and is no longer an alias to `unixtools`. Use the `unixtools.util-linux` package for access to the Apple variants of the utilities.

- `services.keyd` changed API. Now you can create multiple configuration files.

- `baloo`, the file indexer/search engine used by KDE now has a patch to prevent files from constantly being reindexed when the device ids of the their underlying storage changes. This happens frequently when using btrfs or LVM. The patch has not yet been accepted upstream but it provides a significantly improved experience. When upgrading, reset baloo to get a clean index: `balooctl disable ; balooctl purge ; balooctl enable`.

- The `vlock` program from the `kbd` package has been moved into its own package output and should now be referenced explicitly as `kbd.vlock` or replaced with an alternative such as the standalone `vlock` package or `physlock`.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoFormat` now uses `systemd-makefs`, which does not accept formatting options. Therefore, `fileSystems.<name>.formatOptions` has been removed.

- `fileSystems.<name>.autoResize` now uses `systemd-growfs` to resize the file system online in stage 2. This means that `f2fs` and `ext2` can no longer be auto resized, while `xfs` and `btrfs` now can be.

- `fuse3` has been updated from 3.11.0 to 3.16.2; see [ChangeLog.rst](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.16.2/ChangeLog.rst#libfuse-3162-2023-10-10) for an overview of the changes.

  Unsupported mount options are no longer silently accepted [(since 3.15.0)](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-3.16.2/ChangeLog.rst#libfuse-3150-2023-06-09). The [affected mount options](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/commit/dba6b3983af34f30de01cf532dff0b66f0ed6045) are: `atime`, `diratime`, `lazytime`, `nolazytime`, `relatime`, `norelatime`, `strictatime`.

  For example,

  ```bash
  $ sshfs 127.0.0.1:/home/test/testdir /home/test/sshfs_mnt -o atime`
  ```

  would previously terminate successfully with the mount point established, now it outputs the error message ``fuse: unknown option(s): `-o atime'`` and terminates with exit status 1.

- `nixos-rebuild {switch,boot,test,dry-activate}` now runs the system activation inside `systemd-run`, creating an ephemeral systemd service and protecting the system switch against issues like network disconnections during remote (e.g. SSH) sessions. This has the side effect of running the switch in an isolated environment, that could possible break post-switch scripts that depends on things like environment variables being set. If you want to opt-out from this behavior for now, you may set the `NIXOS_SWITCH_USE_DIRTY_ENV` environment variable before running `nixos-rebuild`. However, keep in mind that this option will be removed in the future.

- The `services.vaultwarden.config` option default value was changed to make Vaultwarden only listen on localhost, following the [secure defaults for most NixOS services](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/100192).

- `services.lemmy.settings.federation` was removed in 0.17.0 and no longer has any effect. To enable federation, the hostname must be set in the configuration file and then federation must be enabled in the admin web UI. See the [release notes](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/c32585b03429f0f76d1e4ff738786321a0a9df98/RELEASES.md#upgrade-instructions) for more details.

- `pict-rs` was upgraded from 0.3 to 0.4 and contains an incompatible database & configuration change. To upgrade on systems with `stateVersion = "23.05";` or older follow the migration steps from https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/pict-rs#user-content-0-3-to-0-4-migration-guide and set `services.pict-rs.package = pkgs.pict-rs;`.

- The following packages in `haskellPackages` have now a separate bin output: `cabal-fmt`, `calligraphy`, `eventlog2html`, `ghc-debug-brick`, `hindent`, `nixfmt`, `releaser`. This means you need to replace e.g. `"${pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}/bin/nixfmt"` with `"${lib.getBin pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}/bin/nixfmt"` or `"${lib.getExe pkgs.haskellPackages.nixfmt}"`. The binaries also won’t be in scope if you rely on them being installed e.g. via `ghcWithPackages`. `environment.packages` picks the `bin` output automatically, so for normal installation no intervention is required. Also, toplevel attributes like `pkgs.nixfmt` are not impacted negatively by this change.

- `spamassassin` no longer supports the `Hashcash` module. The module needs to be removed from the `loadplugin` list if it was copied over from the default `initPreConf` option.

- `nano` was removed from `environment.defaultPackages`. To not leave systems without a editor, now `programs.nano.enable` is enabled by default.

- `programs.nano.nanorc` and `programs.nano.syntaxHighlight` no longer have an effect unless `programs.nano.enable` is set to true which is the default.

- `services.outline.sequelizeArguments` has been removed, as `outline` no longer executes database migrations via the `sequelize` cli.

- The binary of the package `cloud-sql-proxy` has changed from `cloud_sql_proxy` to `cloud-sql-proxy`.

- Garage has been upgraded to 0.9.x. `services.garage.package` now needs to be explicitly set, so version upgrades can be done in a controlled fashion. For this, we expose `garage_x_y` attributes which can be set here.

- `voms` and `xrootd` now moves the `$out/etc` content to the `$etc` output instead of `$out/etc.orig`, when input argument `externalEtc` is not `null`.

- The `woodpecker-*` CI packages have been updated to 1.0.0. This release is wildly incompatible with the 0.15.X versions that were previously packaged. Please read [upstream's documentation](https://woodpecker-ci.org/docs/next/migrations#100) to learn how to update your CI configurations.

- The Caddy module gained a new option named `services.caddy.enableReload` which is enabled by default. It allows reloading the service instead of restarting it, if only a config file has changed. This option must be disabled if you have turned off the [Caddy admin API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#admin). If you keep this option enabled, you should consider setting [`grace_period`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#grace-period) to a non-infinite value to prevent Caddy from delaying the reload indefinitely.

- mdraid support is now optional. This reduces initramfs size and prevents the potentially undesired automatic detection and activation of software RAID pools. It is disabled by default in new configurations (determined by `stateVersion`), but the appropriate settings will be generated by `nixos-generate-config` when installing to a software RAID device, so the standard installation procedure should be unaffected. If you have custom configs relying on mdraid, ensure that you use `stateVersion` correctly or set `boot.swraid.enable` manually. On systems with an updated `stateVersion` we now also emit warnings if `mdadm.conf` does not contain the minimum required configuration necessary to run the dynamically enabled monitoring daemons.

- The `go-ethereum` package has been updated to v1.12.0. This drops support for proof-of-work. Its GraphQL API now encodes all numeric values as hex strings and the GraphQL UI is updated to version 2.0. The default database has changed from `leveldb` to `pebble` but `leveldb` can be forced with the --db.engine=leveldb flag. The `checkpoint-admin` command was [removed along with trusted checkpoints](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27147).

- The `aseprite-unfree` package has been upgraded from 1.2.16.3 to 1.2.40. The free version of aseprite has been dropped because it is EOL and the package attribute now points to the unfree version. A maintained fork of the last free version of Aseprite, named 'LibreSprite', is available in the `libresprite` package.

- The default `kops` version is now 1.28.0 and support for 1.25 and older has been dropped.

- `pharo` has been updated to latest stable (PharoVM 10.0.8), which is compatible with the latest stable and oldstable images (Pharo 10 and 11). The VM in question is the 64bit Spur. The 32bit version has been dropped due to lack of maintenance. The Cog VM has been deleted because it is severily outdated. Finally, the `pharo-launcher` package has been deleted because it was not compatible with the newer VM, and due to lack of maintenance.

- Emacs mainline version 29 was introduced. This new version includes many major additions, most notably `tree-sitter` support (enabled by default) and the pgtk variant (useful for Wayland users), which is available under the attribute `emacs29-pgtk`.

- Emacs macport version 29 was introduced.

- The option `services.networking.networkmanager.enableFccUnlock` was removed in favor of `networking.networkmanager.fccUnlockScripts`, which allows specifying unlock scripts explicitly. The previous option enabled all unlock scripts bundled with ModemManager, which is risky, and didn't allow using vendor-provided unlock scripts at all.

- The `html-proofer` package has been updated from major version 3 to major version 5, which includes [breaking changes](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/blob/v5.0.8/UPGRADING.md).

- `kratos` has been updated from 0.10.1 to the first stable version 1.0.0, please read the [0.10.1 to 0.11.0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v0.11.0), [0.11.0 to 0.11.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v0.11.1), [0.11.1 to 0.13.0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v0.13.0) and [0.13.0 to 1.0.0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v1.0.0) upgrade guides. The most notable breaking change is the introduction of one-time passwords (`code`) and update of the default recovery strategy from `link` to `code`.

- The `hail` NixOS module was removed, as `hail` was unmaintained since 2017.

- Package `noto-fonts-emoji` was renamed to `noto-fonts-color-emoji`;
  see [#221181](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/221181).

- Package `cloud-sql-proxy` was renamed to `google-cloud-sql-proxy` as it cannot be used with other cloud providers.;

- Package `pash` was removed due to being archived upstream. Use `powershell` as an alternative.

- The option `services.plausible.releaseCookiePath` has been removed: Plausible does not use any distributed Erlang features, and does not plan to (see [discussion](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/130297#issuecomment-1805851333)), so NixOS now disables them, and the Erlang cookie becomes unnecessary. You may delete the file that `releaseCookiePath` was set to.

- `security.sudo.extraRules` now includes `root`'s default rule, with ordering
  priority 400. This is functionally identical for users not specifying rule
  order, or relying on `mkBefore` and `mkAfter`, but may impact users calling
  `mkOrder n` with n ≤ 400.

- X keyboard extension (XKB) options have been reorganized into a single attribute set, `services.xserver.xkb`. Specifically, `services.xserver.layout` is now `services.xserver.xkb.layout`, `services.xserver.extraLayouts` is now `services.xserver.xkb.extraLayouts`, `services.xserver.xkbModel` is now `services.xserver.xkb.model`, `services.xserver.xkbOptions` is now `services.xserver.xkb.options`, `services.xserver.xkbVariant` is now `services.xserver.xkb.variant`, and `services.xserver.xkbDir` is now `services.xserver.xkb.dir`.

- `networking.networkmanager.firewallBackend` was removed as NixOS is now using iptables-nftables-compat even when using iptables, therefore Networkmanager now uses the nftables backend unconditionally.

- [`lib.lists.foldl'`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable#function-library-lib.lists.foldl-prime) now always evaluates the initial accumulator argument first.
  If you depend on the lazier behavior, consider using [`lib.lists.foldl`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable#function-library-lib.lists.foldl) or [`builtins.foldl'`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/builtins.html#builtins-foldl') instead.

- [`lib.attrsets.foldlAttrs`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable#function-library-lib.attrsets.foldlAttrs) now always evaluates the initial accumulator argument first.

- `rome` was removed because it is no longer maintained and is succeeded by `biome`.

- The `prometheus-knot-exporter` was migrated to a version maintained by CZ.NIC. Various metric names have changed, so checking existing rules is recommended.

- The `services.mtr-exporter.target` has been removed in favor of `services.mtr-exporter.jobs` which allows specifying multiple targets.

- `blender-with-packages` has been deprecated in favor of `blender.withPackages`, for example `blender.withPackages (ps: [ps.bpycv])`. It behaves similarly to `python3.withPackages`.

- Setting `nixpkgs.config` options while providing an external `pkgs` instance will now raise an error instead of silently ignoring the options. NixOS modules no longer set `nixpkgs.config` to accomodate this. This specifically affects `services.locate`, `services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.greeters.tiny` and `programs.firefox` NixOS modules. No manual intervention should be required in most cases, however, configurations relying on those modules affecting packages outside the system environment should switch to explicit overlays.

- `service.borgmatic.settings.location` and `services.borgmatic.configurations.<name>.location` are deprecated, please move your options out of sections to the global scope.

- `privacyidea` (and the corresponding `privacyidea-ldap-proxy`) has been removed from nixpkgs because it has severely outdated dependencies that became unmaintainable with nixpkgs' python package-set.

- `dagger` was removed because using a package called `dagger` and packaging it from source violates their trademark policy.

- `win-virtio` package was renamed to `virtio-win` to be consistent with the upstream package name.

- `ps3netsrv` has been replaced with the webman-mod fork, the executable has been renamed from `ps3netsrv++` to `ps3netsrv` and cli parameters have changed.

- `ssm-agent` package and module were renamed to `amazon-ssm-agent` to be consistent with the upstream package name.

- `services.kea.{ctrl-agent,dhcp-ddns,dhcp,dhcp6}` now use separate runtime directories instead of `/run/kea` to work around the runtime directory being cleared on service start.

- `mkDerivation` now rejects MD5 hashes.

- The `junicode` font package has been updated to [major version 2](https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/releases/tag/v2.001), which is now a font family. In particular, plain `Junicode.ttf` no longer exists. In addition, TrueType font files are now placed in `font/truetype` instead of `font/junicode-ttf`; this change does not affect use via `fonts.packages` NixOS option.

- The `prayer` package as well as `services.prayer` have been removed because it's been unmaintained for several years and the author's website has vanished.

- The `chrony` NixOS module now tracks the Real-Time Clock drift from the System Clock with `rtcfile` and automatically adjusts it with `rtcautotrim` when it exceeds the maximum error specified in `services.chrony.autotrimThreshold` (default 30 seconds). If you enabled `rtcsync` in `extraConfig`, you should remove RTC related options from `extraConfig`. If you do not want chrony configured to keep the RTC in check, you can set `services.chrony.enableRTCTrimming = false;`

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.11-notable-changes}

- A new option `system.switch.enable` was added. By default, this is option is
  enabled. Disabling it makes the system unable to be reconfigured via
  `nixos-rebuild`. This is good for image based appliances where updates are
  handled outside the image.

- The Cinnamon module now enables XDG desktop integration by default. If you are experiencing collisions related to xdg-desktop-portal-gtk you can safely remove `xdg.portal.extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];` from your NixOS configuration.

- GNOME, Pantheon, Cinnamon module no longer forces Qt applications to use Adwaita style since it was buggy and is no longer maintained upstream (specifically, Cinnamon now defaults to the gtk2 style instead, following the default in Linux Mint). If you still want it, you can add the following options to your configuration but it will probably be eventually removed:

  ```nix
  qt = {
    enable = true;
    platformTheme = "gnome";
    style = "adwaita";
  };
  ```

- `fontconfig` now defaults to using greyscale antialiasing instead of subpixel antialiasing because of a [recommendation from one of the downstreams](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/-/issues/337). You can change this value by configuring [](#opt-fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba) accordingly.

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v27 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud27`). The installation logic is as follows:
  - If [`services.nextcloud.package`](#opt-services.nextcloud.package) is specified explicitly, this package will be installed (**recommended**)
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.11, `pkgs.nextcloud27` will be installed by default.
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.05, `pkgs.nextcloud26` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v25 (or older) to v27 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud26` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud26;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).

- New options were added to `services.searx` for better SearXNG support, including options for the built-in rate limiter and bot protection and automatically configuring a local redis server.

- `jq` was updated to 1.7, its [first release in 5 years](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/tag/jq-1.7).

- `zfs` was updated from 2.1.x to 2.2.0, [enabling newer kernel support and adding new features](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.2.0).

- Elixir now defaults to version
  [v1.15](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2023/06/19/elixir-v1-15-0-released/).

- A new option was added to the virtualisation module that enables specifying explicitly named network interfaces in QEMU VMs. The existing `virtualisation.vlans` is still supported for cases where the name of the network interface is irrelevant.

- DocBook option documentation is no longer supported, all module documentation now uses markdown.

- `services.outline` can now be configured to use local filesystem storage instead of S3 storage using [services.outline.storage.storageType](#opt-services.outline.storage.storageType).

- `paperwork` was updated to version 2.2. Documents scanned with this version will not be visible to previous versions if you downgrade. See the [upstream announcement](https://forum.openpaper.work/t/paperwork-2-2-testing-phase/316#important-switch-from-jpeg-to-png-for-new-pages-2) for details and workarounds.

- `buildGoModule` `go-modules` attrs have been renamed to `goModules`.

- The `fonts.fonts` and `fonts.enableDefaultFonts` options have been renamed to `fonts.packages` and `fonts.enableDefaultPackages` respectively.

- The `services.sslh` module has been updated to follow [RFC 0042](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-config-option.md). As such, several options have been moved to the freeform attribute set [services.sslh.settings](#opt-services.sslh.settings), which allows to change any of the settings in {manpage}`sslh(8)`.
  In addition, the newly added option [services.sslh.method](#opt-services.sslh.method) allows to switch between the {manpage}`fork(2)`, {manpage}`select(2)` and `libev`-based connection handling method; see the [sslh docs](https://github.com/yrutschle/sslh/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md#binaries) for a comparison.

- `pkgs.openvpn3` now optionally supports systemd-resolved. `programs.openvpn3` will automatically enable systemd-resolved support if `config.services.resolved.enable` is enabled.

- `services.fail2ban.jails` can now be configured with attribute sets defining settings and filters instead of lines. The stringed options `daemonConfig` and `extraSettings` have respectively been replaced by `daemonSettings` and `jails.DEFAULT.settings` which use attribute sets.

- The application firewall `opensnitch` now uses the process monitor method eBPF as default as recommended by upstream. The method can be changed with the setting [services.opensnitch.settings.ProcMonitorMethod](#opt-services.opensnitch.settings.ProcMonitorMethod).

- `services.hedgedoc` has been heavily refactored, reducing the amount of declared options in the module. Most of the options should still work without any changes. Some options have been deprecated, as they no longer have any effect. See [#244941](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/244941) for more details.

- The [services.woodpecker-server](#opt-services.woodpecker-server.environmentFile) type was changed to list of paths to be more consistent to the woodpecker-agent module

- The module [services.ankisyncd](#opt-services.ankisyncd.package) has been switched to [anki-sync-server-rs](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server-rs) from the old python version, which was difficult to update, had not been updated in a while, and did not support recent versions of anki.
Unfortunately all servers supporting new clients (newer version of anki-sync-server, anki's built in sync server and this new rust package) do not support the older sync protocol that was used in the old server, so such old clients will also need updating and in particular the anki package in nixpkgs is also being updated in this release.
The module update takes care of the new config syntax and the data itself (user login and cards) are compatible, so users of the module will be able to just log in again after updating both client and server without any extra action.

- `services.matrix-synapse` has new options to configure worker processes for matrix-synapse using [`services.matrix-synapse.workers`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.workers). It's also now possible to configure a local redis server using [`services.matrix-synapse.configureRedisLocally`](#opt-services.matrix-synapse.configureRedisLocally).

- `services.nginx` gained a `defaultListen` option at server-level with support for PROXY protocol listeners, also `proxyProtocol` is now exposed in `services.nginx.virtualHosts.<name>.listen` option. It is now possible to run PROXY listeners and non-PROXY listeners at a server-level, see [#213510](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/213510/) for more details.

- `services.restic.backups` now adds wrapper scripts to your system path, which set the same environment variables as the service, so restic operations can easily be run from the command line. This behavior can be disabled by setting `createWrapper` to `false`, per backup configuration.

- `services.prometheus.exporters` has a new exporter to monitor electrical power consumption based on PowercapRAPL sensor called [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre), see [#239803](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/239803) for more details.

- The MariaDB C client library was upgraded from 3.2.x to 3.3.x. It is recommended to review the [upstream release notes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-connector-c-33-release-notes/).

- The module `services.calibre-server` has new options to configure the `host`, `port`, `auth.enable`, `auth.mode` and `auth.userDb` path, see [#216497](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/216497/) for more details.

- Mattermost has been upgraded to extended support version 8.1 as the previously
  packaged extended support version 7.8 is [reaching end of life](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/extended-support-release.html).
  Migration may take some time, see the [changelog](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/self-managed-changelog.html#release-v8-1-extended-support-release)
  and [important upgrade notes](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes.html).

- `services.prometheus.exporters` has a new [exporter](https://github.com/hipages/php-fpm_exporter) to monitor PHP-FPM processes, see [#240394](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/240394) for more details.

- `services.github-runner` / `services.github-runners.<name>` gained the option `nodeRuntimes`. The option defaults to `[ "node20" ]`, i.e., the service supports Node.js 20 GitHub Actions only. The list of Node.js versions accepted by `nodeRuntimes` tracks the versions the upstream GitHub Actions runner supports. See [#249103](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/249103) for details.

- `programs.gnupg.agent.pinentryFlavor` is now set in `/etc/gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`, and will no longer take precedence over a `pinentry-program` set in `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`.

- `programs.gnupg` now has the option `agent.settings` to set verbatim config values in `/etc/gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`.

- `dockerTools.buildImage`, `dockerTools.buildLayeredImage` and `dockerTools.streamLayeredImage` now use `lib.makeOverridable` to allow `dockerTools`-based images to be customized more efficiently at the nix-level.

- `services.influxdb2` now supports doing an automatic initial setup and provisioning of users, organizations, buckets and authentication tokens, see [#249502](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/249502) for more details.

- `wrapHelm` now exposes `passthru.pluginsDir` which can be passed to `helmfile`. For convenience, a top-level package `helmfile-wrapped` has been added, which inherits `passthru.pluginsDir` from `kubernetes-helm-wrapped`. See [#217768](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/217768) for details.

- `boot.initrd.network.udhcp.enable` allows control over dhcp during stage 1 regardless of what `networking.useDHCP` is set to.

- Suricata was upgraded from 6.0 to 7.0 and no longer considers HTTP/2 support as experimental, see [upstream release notes](https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-7-0-0-released/3715) for more details.

- Cloud support in the `netdata` package is now disabled by default. To enable it use the `netdataCloud` package.

- `networking.nftables` now has the option `networking.nftables.table.<table>` to create tables
  and have them be updated atomically, instead of flushing the ruleset.

- `networking.nftables` is no longer flushing all rulesets on every reload.
  Use `networking.nftables.flushRuleset = true;` to get back the old behaviour.

- The `cawbird` package is dropped from nixpkgs, as it got broken by the Twitter API closing down and has been abandoned upstream.

- `hardware.nvidia` gained `datacenter` options for enabling NVIDIA Data Center drivers and configuration of NVLink/NVSwitch topologies through `nv-fabricmanager`.

- Certificate generation via the `security.acme` now limits the concurrent number of running certificate renewals and generation jobs, to avoid spiking resource usage when processing many certificates at once. The limit defaults to *5* and can be adjusted via `maxConcurrentRenewals`. Setting it to *0* disables the limits altogether.

- New `boot.bcache.enable` (default enabled) allows completely removing `bcache` mount support.

- The module `services.mbpfan` now has the option `aggressive` enabled by default for better heat moderation. You can disable it for upstream defaults.

- `security.sudo` now provides two extra options, that do not change the
  module's default behaviour:
  - `defaultOptions` controls the options used for the default rules;
  - `keepTerminfo` controls whether `TERMINFO` and `TERMINFO_DIRS` are preserved
    for `root` and the `wheel` group.

- `virtualisation.googleComputeImage` now provides `efi` option to support UEFI booting.

- CoreDNS can now be built with external plugins by overriding `externalPlugins` and `vendorHash` arguments like this:

  ```
  services.coredns = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.coredns.override {
      externalPlugins = [
        {name = "fanout"; repo = "github.com/networkservicemesh/fanout"; version = "v1.9.1";}
      ];
      vendorHash = "<SRI hash>";
    };
  };
  ```

  To get the necessary SRI hash, set `vendorHash = "";`. The build will fail and produce the correct `vendorHash` in the error message.

  If you use this feature, updates to CoreDNS may require updating `vendorHash` by following these steps again.

- `postgresql_11` has been removed since it'll stop receiving fixes on November 9 2023.

- `ffmpeg` default upgraded from `ffmpeg_5` to `ffmpeg_6`.

- `fusuma` now enables the following plugins: [appmatcher](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-appmatcher), [keypress](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-keypress), [sendkey](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-sendkey), [tap](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-tap) and [wmctrl](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-wmctrl).

- `services.bitcoind` now properly respects the `enable` option.

- The Home Assistant module now offers support for installing custom components and lovelace modules. Available at [`services.home-assistant.customComponents`](#opt-services.home-assistant.customComponents) and [`services.home-assistant.customLovelaceModules`](#opt-services.home-assistant.customLovelaceModules).

- The argument `vendorSha256` of `buildGoModule` is deprecated. Use `vendorHash` instead. ([\#259999](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/259999))

## Nixpkgs internals {#sec-release-23.11-nixpkgs-internals}

- Node.js v14, v16 has been removed as they were end of life. Any dependent packages that contributors were not able to reasonably upgrade were dropped after a month of notice to their maintainers, were **removed**.
  - This includes VSCode Server.
  - This includes Kibana 7 as the ELK stack is unmaintained in nixpkgs and is marked for slow removal.

- The use of `sourceRoot = "source";`, `sourceRoot = "source/subdir";`, and similar lines in package derivations using the default `unpackPhase` is deprecated as it requires `unpackPhase` to always produce a directory named "source". Use `sourceRoot = src.name`, `sourceRoot = "${src.name}/subdir";`, or `setSourceRoot = "sourceRoot=$(echo */subdir)";` or similar instead.

- The `django` alias in the python package set was upgraded to Django 4.x.
  Applications that consume Django should always pin their python environment
  to a compatible major version, so they can move at their own pace.

  ```nix
  python = python3.override {
    packageOverrides = self: super: {
      django = super.django_3;
    };
  };
  ```

- The `qemu-vm.nix` module by default now identifies block devices via
  persistent names available in `/dev/disk/by-*`. Because the rootDevice is
  identified by its filesystem label, it needs to be formatted before the VM is
  started. The functionality of automatically formatting the rootDevice in the
  initrd is removed from the QEMU module. However, for tests that depend on
  this functionality, a test utility for the scripted initrd is added
  (`nixos/tests/common/auto-format-root-device.nix`). To use this in a NixOS
  test, import the module, e.g. `imports = [
  ./common/auto-format-root-device.nix ];` When you use the systemd initrd, you
  can automatically format the root device by setting
  `virtualisation.fileSystems."/".autoFormat = true;`.

- `python3.pkgs.flitBuildHook` has been removed. Use `flit-core` and `format = "pyproject"` instead.

- The `extend` function of `llvmPackages` has been removed due it coming from the `tools` attrset thus only extending the `tool` attrset. A possible replacement is to construct the set from `libraries` and `tools`, or patch nixpkgs.

- The `qemu-vm.nix` module now supports disabling overriding `fileSystems` with
  `virtualisation.fileSystems`. This enables the user to boot VMs from
  "external" disk images not created by the qemu-vm module. You can stop the
  qemu-vm module from overriding `fileSystems` by setting
  `virtualisation.fileSystems = lib.mkForce { };`.

- The `electron` packages now places its application files in `$out/libexec/electron` instead of `$out/lib/electron`. Packages using electron-builder will fail to build and need to be adjusted by changing `lib` to `libexec`.

- `teleport` has been upgraded from major version 12 to major version 14. Please see upstream [upgrade instructions](https://goteleport.com/docs/management/operations/upgrading/) and release notes for versions [13](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1300-050823) and [14](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1400-092023). Note that Teleport does not officially support upgrades across more than one major version at a time. If you're running Teleport server components, it is recommended to first upgrade to an intermediate 13.x version by setting `services.teleport.package = pkgs.teleport_13`. Afterwards, this option can be removed to upgrade to the default version (14).

- The Linux kernel module `msr` (see [`msr(4)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/msr.4.html)), which provides an interface to read and write the model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU, can now be configured via `hardware.cpu.x86.msr`.

- Docker now defaults to 24, as 20.10 is stopping to receive security updates and bug fixes after [December 10, 2023](https://github.com/moby/moby/discussions/45104).

- There is a new NixOS option when writing NixOS tests `testing.initrdBackdoor`, that enables `backdoor.service` in initrd. Requires `boot.initrd.systemd.enable` to be enabled. Boot will pause in stage 1 at `initrd.target`, and will listen for commands from the `Machine` python interface, just like stage 2 normally does. This enables commands to be sent to test and debug stage 1. Use `machine.switch_root()` to leave stage 1 and proceed to stage 2.
