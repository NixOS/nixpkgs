# Release 23.05 (“Stoat”, 2023.05/??) {#sec-release-23.05}

Support is planned until the end of December 2023, handing over to 23.11.

## Highlights {#sec-release-23.05-highlights}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Core version changes:

  - default linux: 5.15 -\> 6.1, all supported kernels available

  - systemd has been updated to v253.1, see [the pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/216826) for more info.
    It's recommended to use `nixos-rebuild boot` and `reboot`, rather than `nixos-rebuild switch` - since in some rare cases
    the switch of a live system might fail.

  - glibc: 2.35 -\> 2.37

- Cinnamon has been updated to 5.6, see [the pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/201328#issue-1449910204) for what is changed.

- GNOME has been upgraded to version 44. Please see the [release notes](https://release.gnome.org/44/) for details.

- KDE Plasma has been updated to v5.27, see [the release notes](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.27.0/) for what is changed.

- `nixos-rebuild` now supports an extra `--specialisation` option that can be used to change specialisation for `switch` and `test` commands.

- `libxcrypt`, the library providing the `crypt(3)` password hashing function, is now built without support for algorithms not flagged [`strong`](https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/blob/v4.4.33/lib/hashes.conf#L48). This affects the availability of password hashing algorithms used for system login (`login(1)`, `passwd(1)`), but also Apache2 Basic-Auth, Samba, OpenLDAP, Dovecot, and [many other packages](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ANixOS%2Fnixpkgs%20libxcrypt&type=code).

- `boot.bootspec.enable` (internal option) is now enabled by default because [RFC-0125](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/125) was merged. This means you will have a bootspec document called `boot.json` generated for each system and specialisation in the top-level. This is useful to enable advanced boot usecases in NixOS such as SecureBoot.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `carnix` and `cratesIO` has been removed due to being unmaintained, use alternatives such as [naersk](https://github.com/nix-community/naersk) and [crate2nix](https://github.com/kolloch/crate2nix) instead.

- `services.asusd` configuration now uses strings instead of structured configuration, as upstream switched to the [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) configuration format. Support for structured configuration may return when [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) generation is implemented in nixpkgs.

- `checkInputs` have been renamed to `nativeCheckInputs`, because they behave the same as `nativeBuildInputs` when `doCheck` is set. `checkInputs` now denote a new type of dependencies, added to `buildInputs` when `doCheck` is set. As a rule of thumb, `nativeCheckInputs` are tools on `$PATH` used during the tests, and `checkInputs` are libraries which are linked to executables built as part of the tests. Similarly, `installCheckInputs` are renamed to `nativeInstallCheckInputs`, corresponding to `nativeBuildInputs`, and `installCheckInputs` are a new type of dependencies added to `buildInputs` when `doInstallCheck` is set. (Note that this change will not cause breakage to derivations with `strictDeps` unset, which are most packages except python, rust, ocaml and go packages).

- `buildDunePackage` now defaults to `strictDeps = true` which means that any library should go into `buildInputs` or `checkInputs`. Any executable that is run on the building machine should go into `nativeBuildInputs` or `nativeCheckInputs` respectively. Example of executables are `ocaml`, `findlib` and `menhir`. PPXs are libraries which are built by dune and should therefore not go into `nativeBuildInputs`.

- `borgbackup` module now has an option for inhibiting system sleep while backups are running, defaulting to off (not inhibiting sleep), available as [`services.borgbackup.jobs.<name>.inhibitsSleep`](#opt-services.borgbackup.jobs._name_.inhibitsSleep).

- The `ssh` client tool now disables the `~C` escape sequence by default. This can be re-enabled by setting `EnableEscapeCommandline yes`

- The `ssh` module does not read `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2` anymore since this location is [deprecated since 2001](https://marc.info/?l=openssh-unix-dev&m=100508718416162&w=2).

- The openssh module does not read `~/.ssh/authorized_keys2` anymore since this location is [deprecated since 2001](https://marc.info/?l=openssh-unix-dev&m=100508718416162&w=2).

- `podman` now uses the `netavark` network stack. Users will need to delete all of their local containers, images, volumes, etc, by running `podman system reset --force` once before upgrading their systems.

- `git-bug` has been updated to at least version 0.8.0, which includes backwards incompatible changes. The `git-bug-migration` package can be used to upgrade existing repositories.

- `nushell` has been updated to at least version 0.77.0, which includes potential breaking changes in aliases. The old aliases are now available as `old-alias` but it is recommended you migrate to the new format. See [Reworked aliases](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2023-03-14-nushell_0_77.html#reworked-aliases-breaking-changes-kubouch).

- `keepassx` and `keepassx2` have been removed, due to upstream [stopping development](https://www.keepassx.org/index.html%3Fp=636.html). Consider [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) as a maintained alternative.

- The [services.kubo.settings](#opt-services.kubo.settings) option is now no longer stateful. If you changed any of the options in [services.kubo.settings](#opt-services.kubo.settings) in the past and then removed them from your NixOS configuration again, those changes are still in your Kubo configuration file but will now be reset to the default. If you're unsure, you may want to make a backup of your configuration file (probably /var/lib/ipfs/config) and compare after the update.

- The Kubo HTTP API will no longer listen on localhost and will instead only listen on a Unix domain socket by default. Read the [services.kubo.settings.Addresses.API](#opt-services.kubo.settings.Addresses.API) option description for more information.

- The EC2 image module no longer fetches instance metadata in stage-1. This results in a significantly smaller initramfs, since network drivers no longer need to be included, and faster boots, since metadata fetching can happen in parallel with startup of other services.
  This breaks services which rely on metadata being present by the time stage-2 is entered. Anything which reads EC2 metadata from `/etc/ec2-metadata` should now have an `after` dependency on `fetch-ec2-metadata.service`

- `minio` removed support for its legacy filesystem backend in [RELEASE.2022-10-29T06-21-33Z](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2022-10-29T06-21-33Z). This means if your storage was created with the old format, minio will no longer start. Unfortunately minio doesn't provide a an automatic migration, they only provide [instructions how to manually convert the node](https://min.io/docs/minio/windows/operations/install-deploy-manage/migrate-fs-gateway.html). To facilitate this migration we keep around the last version that still supports the old filesystem backend as `minio_legacy_fs`. Use it via `services.minio.package = minio_legacy_fs;` to export your data before switching to the new version. See the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/199318) for more details.

- `services.sourcehut.dispatch` and the corresponding package (`sourcehut.dispatchsrht`) have been removed due to [upstream deprecation](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2022-08-01-dispatch-deprecation-plans/).

- The [services.snapserver.openFirewall](#opt-services.snapserver.openFirewall) module option default value has been changed from `true` to `false`. You will need to explicitly set this option to `true`, or configure your firewall.

- The [services.tmate-ssh-server.openFirewall](#opt-services.tmate-ssh-server.openFirewall) module option default value has been changed from `true` to `false`. You will need to explicitly set this option to `true`, or configure your firewall.

- The [services.unifi-video.openFirewall](#opt-services.unifi-video.openFirewall) module option default value has been changed from `true` to `false`. You will need to explicitly set this option to `true`, or configure your firewall.

- The option `i18n.inputMethod.fcitx5.enableRimeData` has been removed. Default RIME data is now included in `fcitx5-rime` by default, and can be customized using `fcitx5-rime.override { rimeDataPkgs = [ pkgs.rime-data, package2, ... ]; }`

- The udev hwdb.bin file is now built with systemd-hwdb rather than the [deprecated "udevadm hwdb"](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/25714). This may impact mappings where the same key is defined in multiple matching entries. The updated behavior will select the latest definition in case of conflict. In general, this should be a positive change, as the hwdb source files are designed with this ordering in mind. As an example, the mapping of the HP Dev One keyboard scan code for "mute mic" is corrected by this update. This change may impact users who have worked-around previously incorrect mappings.

- Kime has been updated from 2.5.6 to 3.0.2 and the `i18n.inputMethod.kime.config` option has been removed. Users should use `daemonModules`, `iconColor`, and `extraConfig` options under `i18n.inputMethod.kime` instead.

- `tut` has been updated from 1.0.34 to 2.0.0, and now uses the TOML format for the configuration file instead of INI. Additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/RasmusLindroth/tut/releases/tag/2.0.0).

- `i3status-rust` has been updated from 0.22.0 to 0.30.5, and this brings many changes to its configuration format. Additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/blob/v0.30.0/NEWS.md).

- The `wordpress` derivation no longer contains any builtin plugins or themes. If you need them you have to add them back to prevent your site from breaking. You can find them in `wordpressPackages.{plugins,themes}`.

- `llvmPackages_rocm.llvm` will not contain `clang` or `compiler-rt`. `llvmPackages_rocm.clang` will not contain `llvm`. `llvmPackages_rocm.clangNoCompilerRt` has been removed in favor of using `llvmPackages_rocm.clang-unwrapped`.

- `services.xserver.desktopManager.plasma5.excludePackages` has been moved to `environment.plasma5.excludePackages`, for consistency with other Desktop Environments

- The EC2 image module previously detected and automatically mounted ext3-formatted instance store devices and partitions in stage-1 (initramfs), storing `/tmp` on the first discovered device. This behaviour, which only catered to very specific use cases and could not be disabled, has been removed. Users relying on this should provide their own implementation, and probably use ext4 and perform the mount in stage-2.

- `teleport` has been upgraded from major version 10 to major version 12. Please see upstream [upgrade instructions](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/operations/upgrading/) and release notes for versions [11](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1100) and [12](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1201). Note that Teleport does not officially support upgrades across more than one major version at a time. If you're running Teleport server components, it is recommended to first upgrade to an intermediate 11.x version by setting `services.teleport.package = pkgs.teleport_11`. Afterwards, this option can be removed to upgrade to the default version (12).

- The EC2 image module previously detected and activated swap-formatted instance store devices and partitions in stage-1 (initramfs). This behaviour has been removed. Users relying on this should provide their own implementation.

- `fail2ban` has been updated to 1.0.2, which has a few breaking changes compared to 0.11.2 ([changelog for 1.0.1](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/1.0.1/ChangeLog), [changelog for 1.0.2](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/1.0.2/ChangeLog))

- Calling `makeSetupHook` without passing a `name` argument is deprecated.

- Top-level buildPlatform,hostPlatform,targetPlatform have been deprecated, use stdenv.X instead.

- `lib.systems.examples.ghcjs` and consequently `pkgsCross.ghcjs` now use the target triplet `javascript-unknown-ghcjs` instead of `js-unknown-ghcjs`. This has been done to match an [upstream decision](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/commit/6636b670233522f01d002c9b97827d00289dbf5c) to follow Cabal's platform naming more closely. Nixpkgs will also reject `js` as an architecture name.

- `dokuwiki` has been updated from 2023-07-31a (Igor) to 2023-04-04 (Jack Jackrum), which has [completely removed](https://www.dokuwiki.org/changes#release_2023-04-04_jack_jackrum) the options to embed HTML and PHP for security reasons. The [htmlok plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:htmlok) can be used to regain this functionality.

- The old unsupported version 6.x of the ELK-stack and Elastic beats have been removed. Use OpenSearch instead.

- The `cosmoc` package has been removed. The upstream scripts in `cosmocc` should be used instead.

- Qt 5.12 and 5.14 have been removed, as the corresponding branches have been EOL upstream for a long time. This affected under 10 packages in nixpkgs, largely unmaintained upstream as well, however, out-of-tree package expressions may need to be updated manually.

- The [services.wordpress.sites.&lt;name&gt;.plugins](#opt-services.wordpress.sites._name_.plugins) and [services.wordpress.sites.&lt;name&gt;.themes](#opt-services.wordpress.sites._name_.themes) options have been converted from sets to attribute sets to allow for consumers to specify explicit install paths via attribute name.

- [`services.nextcloud.database.createLocally`](#opt-services.nextcloud.database.createLocally) now uses socket authentication and is no longer compatible with password authentication.
  - If you want the module to manage the database for you, unset [`services.nextcloud.config.dbpassFile`](#opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbpassFile) (and [`services.nextcloud.config.dbhost`](#opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbhost), if it's set).
  - If your database is external, simply set [`services.nextcloud.database.createLocally`](#opt-services.nextcloud.database.createLocally) to `false`.
  - If you want to use password authentication **and** create the database locally, you will have to use [`services.mysql`](#opt-services.mysql.enable) to set it up.

- `protonmail-bridge` package has been updated to major version 3.

- Nebula now runs as a system user and group created for each nebula network, using the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` ambient capability on launch rather than starting as root. Ensure that any files each Nebula instance needs to access are owned by the correct user and group, by default `nebula-${networkName}`.

- The `i18n.inputMethod.fcitx` option has been replaced with `i18n.inputMethod.fcitx5` because fcitx 4 `pkgs.fcitx` has been removed.

- In `mastodon` it is now necessary to specify location of file with `PostgreSQL` database password. In `services.mastodon.database.passwordFile` parameter default value `/var/lib/mastodon/secrets/db-password` has been changed to `null`.

- The `--target-host` and `--build-host` options of `nixos-rebuild` no longer treat the `localhost` value specially – to build on/deploy to local machine, omit the relevant flag.

- The `nix.readOnlyStore` option has been renamed to `boot.readOnlyNixStore` to clarify that it configures the NixOS boot process, not the Nix daemon.

- Deprecated `xlibsWrapper` transitional package has been removed in favour of direct use of its constitutents: `xorg.libX11`, `freetype` and others.

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v26 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud26`) which uses PHP 8.2 as interpreter by default. The installation logic is as follows:
  - If `system.stateVersion` is >=23.05, `pkgs.nextcloud26` will be installed by default.
  - If `system.stateVersion` is >=22.11, `pkgs.nextcloud25` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v24 (or older) to v26 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud25` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud25;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).
  - It's recommended to use the latest version available (i.e. v26) and to specify that using `services.nextcloud.package`.

- .NET 5.0 and .NET 3.1 were removed due to being end-of-life, use a newer, supported .NET version - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core

- The iputils package, which is installed by default, no longer provides the
  `ninfod`, `rarpd` and `rdisc` tools. See
  [upstream's release notes](https://github.com/iputils/iputils/releases/tag/20221126)
  for more details and available replacements.

- The ppp plugin `rp-pppoe.so` has been renamed to `pppoe.so` in ppp 2.4.9. Starting from ppp 2.5.0, there is no longer a alias for backwards compatiblity. Configurations that use this plugin must be updated accordingly from `plugin rp-pppoe.so` to `plugin pppoe.so`. See [upstream change](https://github.com/ppp-project/ppp/commit/610a7bd76eb1f99f22317541b35001b1e24877ed).

- [services.xserver.videoDrivers](options.html#opt-services.xserver.videoDrivers) now defaults to the `modesetting` driver over device-specific ones. The `radeon`, `amdgpu` and `nouveau` drivers are still available, but effectively unmaintained and not recommended for use.

- To enable the HTTP3 (QUIC) protocol for a nginx virtual host, set the `quic` attribute on it to true, e.g. `services.nginx.virtualHosts.<name>.quic = true;`.

- The default Asterisk package was changed to v20 from v19. Asterisk versions 16 and 19 have been dropped due to being EOL. You may need to update /var/lib/asterisk to match the template files in `${asterisk-20}/var/lib/asterisk`.

- conntrack helper autodetection has been removed from kernels 6.0 and up upstream, and an assertion was added to ensure things don't silently stop working. Migrate your configuration to assign helpers explicitly or use an older LTS kernel branch as a temporary workaround.

- The `services.pipewire.config` options have been removed, as they have basically never worked correctly. All behavior defined by the default configuration can be overridden with drop-in files as necessary - see [below](#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire) for details.

- The catch-all `hardware.video.hidpi.enable` option was removed. Users on high density displays may want to:

  - Set `services.xserver.upscaleDefaultCursor` to upscale the default X11 cursor for higher resolutions
  - Adjust settings under `fonts.fontconfig` according to preference
  - Adjust `console.font` according to preference, though the kernel will generally choose a reasonably sized font

- `services.pipewire.media-session` and the `pipewire-media-session` package have been removed, as they are no longer supported upstream. Users are encouraged to use `services.pipewire.wireplumber` instead.

- The `baget` package and module was removed due to being unmaintained.

- `go-ethereum` package has been updated to v1.11.5 and the `puppeth` command is no longer available as of v1.11.0.

- The `pnpm` package has be updated to from version 7.29.1 to version 8.1.1 and Node.js 14 support has been discontinued (though, there are workarounds if Node.js 14 is still required)
  - Migration instructions: ["Before updating pnpm to v8 in your CI, regenerate your pnpm-lock.yaml. To upgrade your lockfile, run pnpm install and commit the changes. Existing dependencies will not be updated; however, due to configuration changes in pnpm v8, some missing peer dependencies may be added to the lockfile and some packages may get deduplicated. You can commit the new lockfile even before upgrading Node.js in the CI, as pnpm v7 already supports the new lockfile format."](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v8.0.0)

- The `zplug` package changes its output path from `$out` to `$out/share/zplug`. Users should update their dependency on `${pkgs.zplug}/init.zsh` to `${pkgs.zplug}/share/zplug/init.zsh`.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `vim_configurable` has been renamed to `vim-full` to avoid confusion: `vim-full`'s build-time features are configurable, but both `vim` and `vim-full` are _customizable_ (in the sense of user configuration, like vimrc).

- Pantheon now defaults to Mutter 43 and GNOME settings daemon 43, all Pantheon packages are now tracking elementary OS 7 updates.

- The module for the application firewall `opensnitch` got the ability to configure rules. Available as [services.opensnitch.rules](#opt-services.opensnitch.rules)

- The module `usbmuxd` now has the ability to change the package used by the daemon. In case you're experiencing issues with `usbmuxd` you can try an alternative program like `usbmuxd2`. Available as [services.usbmuxd.package](#opt-services.usbmuxd.package)

- A few openssh options have been moved from extraConfig to the new freeform option `settings` and renamed as follows:
  - `services.openssh.forwardX11` to `services.openssh.settings.X11Forwarding`
  - `services.openssh.kbdInteractiveAuthentication` -> `services.openssh.settings.KbdInteractiveAuthentication`
  - `services.openssh.passwordAuthentication` to `services.openssh.settings.PasswordAuthentication`
  - `services.openssh.useDns` to `services.openssh.settings.UseDns`
  - `services.openssh.permitRootLogin` to `services.openssh.settings.PermitRootLogin`
  - `services.openssh.logLevel` to `services.openssh.settings.LogLevel`
  - `services.openssh.kexAlgorithms` to `services.openssh.settings.KexAlgorithms`
  - `services.openssh.macs` to `services.openssh.settings.Macs`
  - `services.openssh.ciphers` to `services.openssh.settings.Ciphers`
  - `services.openssh.gatewayPorts` to `services.openssh.settings.GatewayPorts`

- `netbox` was updated to 3.5. NixOS' `services.netbox.package` still defaults to 3.3 if `stateVersion` is earlier than 23.05. Please review upstream's breaking changes [for 3.4.0](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v3.4.0) and [for 3.5.0](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v3.5.0), and upgrade NetBox by changing `services.netbox.package`. Database migrations will be run automatically.

- `services.netbox` now support RFC42-style options, through `services.netbox.settings`.

- `services.mastodon` gained a tootctl wrapped named `mastodon-tootctl` similar to `nextcloud-occ` which can be executed from any user and switches to the configured mastodon user with sudo and sources the environment variables.

- DocBook option documentation, which has been deprecated since 22.11, will now cause a warning when documentation is built. Out-of-tree modules should migrate to using CommonMark documentation as outlined in [](#sec-option-declarations) to silence this warning.

  DocBook option documentation support will be removed in the next release and CommonMark will become the default. DocBook option documentation that has not been migrated until then will no longer render properly or cause errors.

- NixOS now defaults to using nsncd (a non-caching reimplementation in Rust) as NSS lookup dispatcher, instead of the buggy and deprecated glibc-provided nscd. If you need to switch back, set `services.nscd.enableNsncd = false`, but please open an issue in nixpkgs so your issue can be fixed.

- `services.borgmatic` now allows for multiple configurations, placed in `/etc/borgmatic.d/`, you can define them with `services.borgmatic.configurations`.

- `service.openafsServer` features a new backup server `pkgs.fabs` as a
  replacement for openafs's own `buserver`. See
  [FABS](https://github.com/openafs-contrib/fabs) to check if this is an viable
  replacement. It stores backups as volume dump files and thus better integrates
  into contemporary backup solutions.

- `services.maddy` got several updates:
  - Configuration of users and their credentials using `services.maddy.ensureCredentials`.
  - Configuration of TLS key and certificate files using `services.maddy.tls`.

- The `dnsmasq` service now takes configuration via the
  `services.dnsmasq.settings` attribute set. The option
  `services.dnsmasq.extraConfig` will be deprecated when NixOS 22.11 reaches
  end of life.

- The `dokuwiki` service is now configured via `services.dokuwiki.sites.<name>.settings` attribute set; `extraConfig` has been removed.
  The `{aclUse,superUser,disableActions}` attributes have been renamed accordingly. `pluginsConfig` now only accepts an attribute set of booleans.
  Passing plain PHP is no longer possible.
  Same applies to `acl` which now also only accepts structured `settings`.

- The `zsh` package changes the way to set environment variables on NixOS systems where `programs.zsh.enable` equals `false`.  It now sources `/etc/set-environment` when reading the system-level `zshenv` file.  Before, it sourced `/etc/profile` when reading the system-level `zprofile` file.

- The `wordpress` service now takes configuration via the `services.wordpress.sites.<name>.settings` attribute set, `extraConfig` is still available to append  additional text to `wp-config.php`.

- To reduce closure size in `nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix` profile disabled installation documentations and manuals. Also disabled `logrotate` and `udisks2` services.

- To reduce closure size in `nixos/modules/installer/netboot/netboot-minimal.nix` profile disabled load linux firmwares, pre-installing the complete stdenv and `networking.wireless` service.

- The minimal ISO image now uses the `nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix` profile.

- The `ghcWithPackages` and `ghcWithHoogle` wrappers will now also symlink GHC's
  and all included libraries' documentation to `$out/share/doc` for convenience.
  If undesired, the old behavior can be restored by overriding the builders with
  `{ installDocumentation = false; }`.

- The new option `networking.nftables.checkRuleset` controls whether the ruleset is checked for syntax or not during build.  It is `true` by default.  The check might fail because it is in a sandbox environment.  To circumvent this, the ruleset file can be edited using the `networking.nftables.preCheckRuleset` option.

- `mastodon` now supports connection to a remote `PostgreSQL` database.

- `nextcloud` has an option to enable SSE-C in S3.

- `services.peertube` now requires you to specify the secret file `secrets.secretsFile`. It can be generated by running `openssl rand -hex 32`.
  Before upgrading, read the release notes for PeerTube:
    - [Release v5.0.0](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v5.0.0)

  And backup your data.

- `services.chronyd` is now started with additional systemd sandbox/hardening options for better security.

- PostgreSQL has opt-in support for [JIT compilation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/jit-reason.html). It can be enabled like this:
  ```nix
  {
    services.postgresql = {
      enable = true;
      enableJIT = true;
    };
  }
  ```

- `services.dhcpcd` service now don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements on interfaces that use static IPv6 addresses.
  If network uses both IPv6 Unique local addresses (ULA) and global IPv6 address auto-configuration with SLAAC, must add the parameter `networking.dhcpcd.IPv6rs = true;`.

- The module `services.headscale` was refactored to be compliant with [RFC 0042](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-config-option.md). To be precise, this means that the following things have changed:

  - Most settings has been migrated under [services.headscale.settings](#opt-services.headscale.settings) which is an attribute-set that
    will be converted into headscale's YAML config format. This means that the configuration from
    [headscale's example configuration](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/blob/main/config-example.yaml)
    can be directly written as attribute-set in Nix within this option.

- `services.kubo` now unmounts `ipfsMountDir` and `ipnsMountDir` even if it is killed unexpectedly when `autoMount` is enabled.

- `nixos/lib/make-disk-image.nix` can now mutate EFI variables, run user-provided EFI firmware or variable templates. This is now extensively documented in the NixOS manual.

- `services.grafana` listens only on localhost by default again. This was changed to upstreams default of `0.0.0.0` by accident in the freeform setting conversion.

- Grafana Tempo has been updated to version 2.0. See the [upstream upgrade guide](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/release-notes/v2-0/#upgrade-considerations) for migration instructions.

- A new `virtualisation.rosetta` module was added to allow running `x86_64` binaries through [Rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment) inside virtualised NixOS guests on Apple silicon. This feature works by default with the [UTM](https://docs.getutm.app/) virtualisation [package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=utm&from=0&size=1&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=utm).

- The new option `users.motdFile` allows configuring a Message Of The Day that can be updated dynamically.

- The `root` package is now built with the `"-Dgnuinstall=ON"` CMake flag, making the output conform the `bin` `lib` `share` layout. In this layout, `tutorials` is under `share/doc/ROOT/`; `cmake`, `font`, `icons`, `js` and `macro` under `share/root`; `Makefile.comp` and `Makefile.config` under `etc/root`.

- Enabling global redirect in `services.nginx.virtualHosts` now allows one to add exceptions with the `locations` option.

- A new option `proxyCachePath` has been added to `services.nginx`. Learn more about proxy_cache_path: <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_path>.

- A new option `recommendedBrotliSettings` has been added to `services.nginx`. Learn more about compression in Brotli format [here](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli/blob/master/README.md).

- Updated recommended settings in `services.nginx.recommendedGzipSettings`:
  - Enables gzip compression for only certain proxied requests.
  - Allow checking and loading of precompressed files.
  - Updated gzip mime-types.
  - Increased the minimum length of a response that will be gzipped.

- [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) version is based on [system.stateVersion](options.html#opt-system.stateVersion), existing installations will keep using version 0.7. New installations will use version 0.8. In order to upgrade a Garage cluster, please follow [upstream instructions](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/documentation/cookbook/upgrading/) and force [services.garage.package](options.html#opt-services.garage.package) or upgrade accordingly [system.stateVersion](options.html#opt-system.stateVersion).

- Nebula now supports the `services.nebula.networks.<name>.isRelay` and `services.nebula.networks.<name>.relays` configuration options for setting up or allowing traffic relaying. See the [announcement](https://www.defined.net/blog/announcing-relay-support-in-nebula/) for more details about relays.

- `hip` has been separated into `hip`, `hip-common` and `hipcc`.

- `services.nginx.recommendedProxySettings` now removes the `Connection` header preventing clients from closing backend connections.

- Resilio sync secret keys can now be provided using a secrets file at runtime, preventing these secrets from ending up in the Nix store.

- The `firewall` and `nat` module now has a nftables based implementation. Enable `networking.nftables` to use it.

- The `services.fwupd` module now allows arbitrary daemon settings to be configured in a structured manner ([`services.fwupd.daemonSettings`](#opt-services.fwupd.daemonSettings)).

- `services.xserver.desktopManager.plasma5.phononBackend` now defaults to vlc according to [upstrean recommendation](https://community.kde.org/Distributions/Packaging_Recommendations#Non-Plasma_packages)

- The `zramSwap` is now implemented with `zram-generator`, and the option `zramSwap.numDevices` for using ZRAM devices as general purpose ephemeral block devices has been removed.

- As Singularity has renamed to [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/news/community-announcement-20211130)
  to distinguish from [an un-renamed fork by Sylabs Inc.](https://sylabs.io/2021/05/singularity-community-edition),
  there are now two packages of Singularity/Apptainer:
  * `apptainer`: From `github.com/apptainer/apptainer`, which is the new repo after renaming.
  * `singularity`: From `github.com/sylabs/singularity`, which is the fork by Sylabs Inc..

  `programs.singularity` got a new `package` option to specify which package to use.

  `singularity-tools.buildImage` got a new input argument `singularity` to specify which package to use.

- The new option `programs.singularity.enableFakeroot`, if set to `true`, provides `--fakeroot` support for `apptainer` and `singularity`.

- The `unifi-poller` package and corresponding NixOS module have been renamed to `unpoller` to match upstream.

- The `rtsp-simple-server` package and corresponding NixOS module have been renamed to `mediamtx` to match upstream.

- The new option `services.tailscale.useRoutingFeatures` controls various settings for using Tailscale features like exit nodes and subnet routers. If you wish to use your machine as an exit node, you can set this setting to `server`, otherwise if you wish to use an exit node you can set this setting to `client`. The strict RPF warning has been removed as the RPF will be loosened automatically based on the value of this setting.

- `openjdk` from version 11 and above is not build with `openjfx` (i.e.: JavaFX) support by default anymore. You can re-enable it by overriding, e.g.: `openjdk11.override { enableJavaFX = true; };`.

- [Xastir](https://xastir.org/index.php/Main_Page) can now access AX.25 interfaces via the `libax25` package.

- `nixos-version` now accepts `--configuration-revision` to display more information about the current generation revision

- The option `services.nomad.extraSettingsPlugins` has been fixed to allow more than one plugin in the path.

- The option `services.prometheus.exporters.pihole.interval` does not exist anymore and has been removed.

- The option `services.gpsd.device` has been replaced with
  `services.gpsd.devices`, which supports multiple devices.

- `k3s` can now be configured with an EnvironmentFile for its systemd service, allowing secrets to be provided without ending up in the Nix Store.

- `gitea` module options have been changed to be RFC042 conforming (i.e. some options were moved to be located under `services.gitea.settings`)

- `boot.initrd.luks.device.<name>` has a new `tryEmptyPassphrase` option, this is useful for OEM's who need to install an encrypted disk with a future settable passphrase

- Lisp gained a [manual section](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#lisp), documenting a new and backwards incompatible interface. The previous interface will be removed in a future release.

- The `bind` module now allows the per-zone `allow-query` setting to be configured (previously it was hard-coded to `any`; it still defaults to `any` to retain compatibility).

- `make-disk-image` handles `contents` arguments that are directories better, fixing a bug where it used to put them in a subdirectory of the intended `target`.

## Detailed migration information {#sec-release-23.05-migration}

### Pipewire configuration overrides {#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire}

#### Why this change? {#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire-why}

The Pipewire config semantics don't really match the NixOS module semantics, so it's extremely awkward to override the default config, especially when lists are involved. Vendoring the configuration files in nixpkgs also creates unnecessary maintenance overhead.

Also, upstream added a lot of accomodations to allow doing most of the things you'd want to do with a config edit in better ways.

#### Migrating your configuration {#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire-how}

Compare your settings to [the defaults](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/tree/master/src/daemon) and where your configuration differs from them.

Then, create a drop-in JSON file in `/etc/pipewire/<config file name>.d/99-custom.conf` (the actual filename can be anything) and migrate your changes to it according to the following sections.

Repeat for every file you've modified, changing the directory name accordingly.

#### Things you can just copy over {#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire-simple}

If you are:

- setting properties via `*.properties`
- loading a new module to `context.modules`
- creating new objects with `context.objects`
- declaring SPA libraries with `context.spa-libs`
- running custom commands with `context.exec`
- adding new rules with `*.rules`
- running custom PulseAudio commands with `pulse.cmd`

Simply move the definitions into the drop-in.

Note that the use of `context.exec` is not recommended and other methods of running your thing are likely a better option.

```json
{
  "context.properties": {
    "your.property.name": "your.property.value"
  },
  "context.modules": [
    { "name": "libpipewire-module-my-cool-thing" }
  ],
  "context.objects": [
    { "factory": { ... } }
  ],
  "alsa.rules": [
    { "matches: { ... }, "actions": { ... } }
  ]
}
```

#### Removing a module from `context.modules` {#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire-removing-modules}

Look for an option to disable it via `context.properties` (`"module.x11.bell": "false"` is likely the most common use case here).
If one is not available, proceed to [Nuclear option](#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire).

#### Modifying a module's parameters in `context.modules` {#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire-modifying-modules}

For most modules (e.g. `libpipewire-module-rt`) it's enough to load the module again with the new arguments, e.g.:

```json
{
  "context.modules": [
    {
      "name": "libpipewire-module-rt",
      "args": {
        "rt.prio": 90
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that `module-rt` specifically will generally use the highest values available by default, so setting limits on the `pipewire` systemd service is preferable to reloading.

If reloading the module is not an option, proceed to [Nuclear option](#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire).

#### Nuclear option {#sec-release-23.05-migration-pipewire-nuclear}
If all else fails, you can still manually copy the contents of the default configuration file
from `${pkgs.pipewire.lib}/share/pipewire` to `/etc/pipewire` and edit it to fully override the default.
However, this should be done only as a last resort. Please talk to the Pipewire maintainers if you ever need to do this.
