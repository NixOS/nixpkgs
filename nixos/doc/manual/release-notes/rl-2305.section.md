## Highlights {#sec-release-23.05-highlights}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- NixOS now uses [systemd-networkd](#opt-systemd.network.enable) as its default networking backend. With networkd, many network configurations which previously required use of [](#opt-networking.localCommands) can be expressed declaratively. Networkd's connection management is also significantly more reliable than the scripted networking implementation previously in use by default. If you wish to continue using scripted networking, set [](#opt-networking.useNetworkd) to `false`.
