## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-23.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `carnix` and `cratesIO` has been removed due to being unmaintained, use alternatives such as [naersk](https://github.com/nix-community/naersk) and [crate2nix](https://github.com/kolloch/crate2nix) instead.

- `checkInputs` have been renamed to `nativeCheckInputs`, because they behave the same as `nativeBuildInputs` when `doCheck` is set. `checkInputs` now denote a new type of dependencies, added to `buildInputs` when `doCheck` is set. As a rule of thumb, `nativeCheckInputs` are tools on `$PATH` used during the tests, and `checkInputs` are libraries which are linked to executables built as part of the tests. Similarly, `installCheckInputs` are renamed to `nativeInstallCheckInputs`, corresponding to `nativeBuildInputs`, and `installCheckInputs` are a new type of dependencies added to `buildInputs` when `doInstallCheck` is set. (Note that this change will not cause breakage to derivations with `strictDeps` unset, which are most packages except python, rust, ocaml and go packages).

- `buildDunePackage` now defaults to `strictDeps = true` which means that any library should go into `buildInputs` or `checkInputs`. Any executable that is run on the building machine should go into `nativeBuildInputs` or `nativeCheckInputs` respectively. Example of executables are `ocaml`, `findlib` and `menhir`. PPXs are libraries which are built by dune and should therefore not go into `nativeBuildInputs`.

- `borgbackup` module now has an option for inhibiting system sleep while backups are running, defaulting to off (not inhibiting sleep), available as [`services.borgbackup.jobs.<name>.inhibitsSleep`](#opt-services.borgbackup.jobs._name_.inhibitsSleep).

- The `ssh` client tool now disables the `~C` escape sequence by default. This can be re-enabled by setting `EnableEscapeCommandline yes`

- `podman` now uses the `netavark` network stack. Users will need to delete all of their local containers, images, volumes, etc, by running `podman system reset --force` once before upgrading their systems.

- `git-bug` has been updated to at least version 0.8.0, which includes backwards incompatible changes. The `git-bug-migration` package can be used to upgrade existing repositories.

- `nushell` has been updated to at least version 0.77.0, which includes potential breaking changes in aliases. The old aliases are now available as `old-alias` but it is recommended you migrate to the new format. See [Reworked aliases](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2023-03-14-nushell_0_77.html#reworked-aliases-breaking-changes-kubouch).

- `keepassx` and `keepassx2` have been removed, due to upstream [stopping development](https://www.keepassx.org/index.html%3Fp=636.html). Consider [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) as a maintained alternative.

- The `services.kubo.settings` option is now no longer stateful. If you changed any of the options in `services.kubo.settings` in the past and then removed them from your NixOS configuration again, those changes are still in your Kubo configuration file but will now be reset to the default. If you're unsure, you may want to make a backup of your configuration file (probably /var/lib/ipfs/config) and compare after the update.

- The EC2 image module no longer fetches instance metadata in stage-1. This results in a significantly smaller initramfs, since network drivers no longer need to be included, and faster boots, since metadata fetching can happen in parallel with startup of other services.
  This breaks services which rely on metadata being present by the time stage-2 is entered. Anything which reads EC2 metadata from `/etc/ec2-metadata` should now have an `after` dependency on `fetch-ec2-metadata.service`

- `minio` removed support for its legacy filesystem backend in [RELEASE.2022-10-29T06-21-33Z](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2022-10-29T06-21-33Z). This means if your storage was created with the old format, minio will no longer start. Unfortunately minio doesn't provide a an automatic migration, they only provide [instructions how to manually convert the node](https://min.io/docs/minio/windows/operations/install-deploy-manage/migrate-fs-gateway.html). To facilitate this migration we keep around the last version that still supports the old filesystem backend as `minio_legacy_fs`. Use it via `services.minio.package = minio_legacy_fs;` to export your data before switching to the new version. See the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/199318) for more details.

- `services.sourcehut.dispatch` and the corresponding package (`sourcehut.dispatchsrht`) have been removed due to [upstream deprecation](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2022-08-01-dispatch-deprecation-plans/).

- The [services.snapserver.openFirewall](#opt-services.snapserver.openFirewall) module option default value has been changed from `true` to `false`. You will need to explicitly set this option to `true`, or configure your firewall.

- The [services.tmate-ssh-server.openFirewall](#opt-services.tmate-ssh-server.openFirewall) module option default value has been changed from `true` to `false`. You will need to explicitly set this option to `true`, or configure your firewall.

- The [services.unifi-video.openFirewall](#opt-services.unifi-video.openFirewall) module option default value has been changed from `true` to `false`. You will need to explicitly set this option to `true`, or configure your firewall.

- Kime has been updated from 2.5.6 to 3.0.2 and the `i18n.inputMethod.kime.config` option has been removed. Users should use `daemonModules`, `iconColor`, and `extraConfig` options under `i18n.inputMethod.kime` instead.

- `tut` has been updated from 1.0.34 to 2.0.0, and now uses the TOML format for the configuration file instead of INI. Additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/RasmusLindroth/tut/releases/tag/2.0.0).

- `i3status-rust` has been updated from 0.22.0 to 0.30.5, and this brings many changes to its configuration format. Additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/blob/v0.30.0/NEWS.md).

- The `wordpress` derivation no longer contains any builtin plugins or themes. If you need them you have to add them back to prevent your site from breaking. You can find them in `wordpressPackages.{plugins,themes}`.

- `llvmPackages_rocm.llvm` will not contain `clang` or `compiler-rt`. `llvmPackages_rocm.clang` will not contain `llvm`. `llvmPackages_rocm.clangNoCompilerRt` has been removed in favor of using `llvmPackages_rocm.clang-unwrapped`.

- `services.xserver.desktopManager.plasma5.excludePackages` has been moved to `environment.plasma5.excludePackages`, for consistency with other Desktop Environments

- The EC2 image module previously detected and automatically mounted ext3-formatted instance store devices and partitions in stage-1 (initramfs), storing `/tmp` on the first discovered device. This behaviour, which only catered to very specific use cases and could not be disabled, has been removed. Users relying on this should provide their own implementation, and probably use ext4 and perform the mount in stage-2.

- `teleport` has been upgraded from major version 10 to major version 12. Please see upstream [upgrade instructions](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/operations/upgrading/) and release notes for versions [11](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1100) and [12](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1201). Note that Teleport does not officially support upgrades across more than one major version at a time. If you're running Teleport server components, it is recommended to first upgrade to an intermediate 11.x version by setting `services.teleport.package = pkgs.teleport_11`. Afterwards, this option can be removed to upgrade to the default version (12).

- The EC2 image module previously detected and activated swap-formatted instance store devices and partitions in stage-1 (initramfs). This behaviour has been removed. Users relying on this should provide their own implementation.

- Calling `makeSetupHook` without passing a `name` argument is deprecated.

- `lib.systems.examples.ghcjs` and consequently `pkgsCross.ghcjs` now use the target triplet `javascript-unknown-ghcjs` instead of `js-unknown-ghcjs`. This has been done to match an [upstream decision](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/commit/6636b670233522f01d002c9b97827d00289dbf5c) to follow Cabal's platform naming more closely. Nixpkgs will also reject `js` as an architecture name.

- The `cosmoc` package has been removed. The upstream scripts in `cosmocc` should be used instead.

- Qt 5.12 and 5.14 have been removed, as the corresponding branches have been EOL upstream for a long time. This affected under 10 packages in nixpkgs, largely unmaintained upstream as well, however, out-of-tree package expressions may need to be updated manually.

- The [services.wordpress.sites.&lt;name&gt;.plugins](#opt-services.wordpress.sites._name_.plugins) and [services.wordpress.sites.&lt;name&gt;.themes](#opt-services.wordpress.sites._name_.themes) options have been converted from sets to attribute sets to allow for consumers to specify explicit install paths via attribute name.

- `protonmail-bridge` package has been updated to v3.0 and the CLI executable is now named bridge instead of protonmail-bridge to be more in line with upstream.

- Nebula now runs as a system user and group created for each nebula network, using the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` ambient capability on launch rather than starting as root. Ensure that any files each Nebula instance needs to access are owned by the correct user and group, by default `nebula-${networkName}`.

- In `mastodon` it is now necessary to specify location of file with `PostgreSQL` database password. In `services.mastodon.database.passwordFile` parameter default value `/var/lib/mastodon/secrets/db-password` has been changed to `null`.

- The `--target-host` and `--build-host` options of `nixos-rebuild` no longer treat the `localhost` value specially – to build on/deploy to local machine, omit the relevant flag.

- The `nix.readOnlyStore` option has been renamed to `boot.readOnlyNixStore` to clarify that it configures the NixOS boot process, not the Nix daemon.

- Deprecated `xlibsWrapper` transitional package has been removed in favour of direct use of its constitutents: `xorg.libX11`, `freetype` and others.

- .NET 5.0 was removed due to being end-of-life, use a newer, supported .NET version - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core

- The iputils package, which is installed by default, no longer provides the
  `ninfod`, `rarpd` and `rdisc` tools. See
  [upstream's release notes](https://github.com/iputils/iputils/releases/tag/20221126)
  for more details and available replacements.

- [services.xserver.videoDrivers](options.html#opt-services.xserver.videoDrivers) now defaults to the `modesetting` driver over device-specific ones. The `radeon`, `amdgpu` and `nouveau` drivers are still available, but effectively unmaintained and not recommended for use.

- conntrack helper autodetection has been removed from kernels 6.0 and up upstream, and an assertion was added to ensure things don't silently stop working. Migrate your configuration to assign helpers explicitly or use an older LTS kernel branch as a temporary workaround.

- The `baget` package and module was removed due to being unmaintained.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-23.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `vim_configurable` has been renamed to `vim-full` to avoid confusion: `vim-full`'s build-time features are configurable, but both `vim` and `vim-full` are _customizable_ (in the sense of user configuration, like vimrc).

- Pantheon now defaults to Mutter 42 and GNOME settings daemon 42, all Pantheon packages are now tracking elementary OS 7 updates.

- The module for the application firewall `opensnitch` got the ability to configure rules. Available as [services.opensnitch.rules](#opt-services.opensnitch.rules)

- The module `usbmuxd` now has the ability to change the package used by the daemon. In case you're experiencing issues with `usbmuxd` you can try an alternative program like `usbmuxd2`. Available as [services.usbmuxd.package](#opt-services.usbmuxd.package)

- A few openssh options have been moved from extraConfig to the new freeform option `settings` and renamed as follows:
  - `services.openssh.forwardX11` to `services.openssh.settings.X11Forwarding`
  - `services.openssh.kbdInteractiveAuthentication` -> `services.openssh.settings.KbdInteractiveAuthentication`
  - `services.openssh.passwordAuthentication` to `services.openssh.settings.PasswordAuthentication`
  - `services.openssh.useDns` to `services.openssh.settings.UseDns`
  - `services.openssh.permitRootLogin` to `services.openssh.settings.PermitRootLogin`
  - `services.openssh.logLevel` to `services.openssh.settings.LogLevel`
  - `services.openssh.kexAlgorithms` to `services.openssh.settings.KexAlgorithms`
  - `services.openssh.macs` to `services.openssh.settings.Macs`
  - `services.openssh.ciphers` to `services.openssh.settings.Ciphers`
  - `services.openssh.gatewayPorts` to `services.openssh.settings.GatewayPorts`

- `services.mastodon` gained a tootctl wrapped named `mastodon-tootctl` similar to `nextcloud-occ` which can be executed from any user and switches to the configured mastodon user with sudo and sources the environment variables.

- DocBook option documentation, which has been deprecated since 22.11, will now cause a warning when documentation is built. Out-of-tree modules should migrate to using CommonMark documentation as outlined in [](#sec-option-declarations) to silence this warning.

  DocBook option documentation support will be removed in the next release and CommonMark will become the default. DocBook option documentation that has not been migrated until then will no longer render properly or cause errors.

- NixOS now defaults to using nsncd (a non-caching reimplementation in Rust) as NSS lookup dispatcher, instead of the buggy and deprecated glibc-provided nscd. If you need to switch back, set `services.nscd.enableNsncd = false`, but please open an issue in nixpkgs so your issue can be fixed.

- `services.borgmatic` now allows for multiple configurations, placed in `/etc/borgmatic.d/`, you can define them with `services.borgmatic.configurations`.

- The `dnsmasq` service now takes configuration via the
  `services.dnsmasq.settings` attribute set. The option
  `services.dnsmasq.extraConfig` will be deprecated when NixOS 22.11 reaches
  end of life.

- The `dokuwiki` service now takes configuration via the `services.dokuwiki.sites.<name>.settings` attribute set, `extraConfig` is deprecated and will be removed.
  The `{aclUse,superUser,disableActions}` attributes have been renamed, `pluginsConfig` now also accepts an attribute set of booleans, passing plain PHP is deprecated.
  Same applies to `acl` which now also accepts structured settings.

- The `wordpress` service now takes configuration via the `services.wordpress.sites.<name>.settings` attribute set, `extraConfig` is still available to append  additional text to `wp-config.php`.

- To reduce closure size in `nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix` profile disabled installation documentations and manuals. Also disabled `logrotate` and `udisks2` services.

- To reduce closure size in `nixos/modules/installer/netboot/netboot-minimal.nix` profile disabled load linux firmwares, pre-installing the complete stdenv and `networking.wireless` service.

- The minimal ISO image now uses the `nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix` profile.

- The `ghcWithPackages` and `ghcWithHoogle` wrappers will now also symlink GHC's
  and all included libraries' documentation to `$out/share/doc` for convenience.
  If undesired, the old behavior can be restored by overriding the builders with
  `{ installDocumentation = false; }`.

- `mastodon` now supports connection to a remote `PostgreSQL` database.

- `nextcloud` has an option to enable SSE-C in S3.

- `services.peertube` now requires you to specify the secret file `secrets.secretsFile`. It can be generated by running `openssl rand -hex 32`.
  Before upgrading, read the release notes for PeerTube:
    - [Release v5.0.0](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v5.0.0)

  And backup your data.

- `services.chronyd` is now started with additional systemd sandbox/hardening options for better security.

- `services.dhcpcd` service now don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements on interfaces that use static IPv6 addresses.

- The module `services.headscale` was refactored to be compliant with [RFC 0042](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-config-option.md). To be precise, this means that the following things have changed:

  - Most settings has been migrated under [services.headscale.settings](#opt-services.headscale.settings) which is an attribute-set that
    will be converted into headscale's YAML config format. This means that the configuration from
    [headscale's example configuration](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/blob/main/config-example.yaml)
    can be directly written as attribute-set in Nix within this option.

- The `hardware.video.hidpi.enable` was renamed to `fonts.optimizeForVeryHighDPI` to be consistent with what it actually does.
  They disable by default: antialiasing, hinting and LCD filter for subpixel rendering. They can be overridden if you experience problems with font rendering.
  On Xorg, the default cursor is upscaled.
  Please see the documentation for the new option to decide if you want to keep it enabled.

- `nixos/lib/make-disk-image.nix` can now mutate EFI variables, run user-provided EFI firmware or variable templates. This is now extensively documented in the NixOS manual.

- `services.grafana` listens only on localhost by default again. This was changed to upstreams default of `0.0.0.0` by accident in the freeform setting conversion.

- Grafana Tempo has been updated to version 2.0. See the [upstream upgrade guide](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/release-notes/v2-0/#upgrade-considerations) for migration instructions.

- A new `virtualisation.rosetta` module was added to allow running `x86_64` binaries through [Rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment) inside virtualised NixOS guests on Apple silicon. This feature works by default with the [UTM](https://docs.getutm.app/) virtualisation [package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=utm&from=0&size=1&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=utm).

- The new option `users.motdFile` allows configuring a Message Of The Day that can be updated dynamically.

- The `root` package is now built with the `"-Dgnuinstall=ON"` CMake flag, making the output conform the `bin` `lib` `share` layout. In this layout, `tutorials` is under `share/doc/ROOT/`; `cmake`, `font`, `icons`, `js` and `macro` under `share/root`; `Makefile.comp` and `Makefile.config` under `etc/root`.

- Enabling global redirect in `services.nginx.virtualHosts` now allows one to add exceptions with the `locations` option.

- A new option `recommendedBrotliSettings` has been added to `services.nginx`. Learn more about compression in Brotli format [here](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli/blob/master/README.md).

- Updated recommended settings in `services.nginx.recommendedGzipSettings`:
  - Enables gzip compression for only certain proxied requests.
  - Allow checking and loading of precompressed files.
  - Updated gzip mime-types.
  - Increased the minimum length of a response that will be gzipped.

- [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) version is based on [system.stateVersion](options.html#opt-system.stateVersion), existing installations will keep using version 0.7. New installations will use version 0.8. In order to upgrade a Garage cluster, please follow [upstream instructions](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/documentation/cookbook/upgrading/) and force [services.garage.package](options.html#opt-services.garage.package) or upgrade accordingly [system.stateVersion](options.html#opt-system.stateVersion).

- Nebula now supports the `services.nebula.networks.<name>.isRelay` and `services.nebula.networks.<name>.relays` configuration options for setting up or allowing traffic relaying. See the [announcement](https://www.defined.net/blog/announcing-relay-support-in-nebula/) for more details about relays.

- `hip` has been separated into `hip`, `hip-common` and `hipcc`.

- `services.nginx.recommendedProxySettings` now removes the `Connection` header preventing clients from closing backend connections.

- Resilio sync secret keys can now be provided using a secrets file at runtime, preventing these secrets from ending up in the Nix store.

- The `firewall` and `nat` module now has a nftables based implementation. Enable `networking.nftables` to use it.

- The `services.fwupd` module now allows arbitrary daemon settings to be configured in a structured manner ([`services.fwupd.daemonSettings`](#opt-services.fwupd.daemonSettings)).

- `services.xserver.desktopManager.plasma5.phononBackend` now defaults to vlc according to [upstrean recommendation](https://community.kde.org/Distributions/Packaging_Recommendations#Non-Plasma_packages)

- The `zramSwap` is now implemented with `zram-generator`, and the option `zramSwap.numDevices` for using ZRAM devices as general purpose ephemeral block devices has been removed.

- As Singularity has renamed to [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/news/community-announcement-20211130)
  to distinguish from [an un-renamed fork by Sylabs Inc.](https://sylabs.io/2021/05/singularity-community-edition),
  there are now two packages of Singularity/Apptainer:
  * `apptainer`: From `github.com/apptainer/apptainer`, which is the new repo after renaming.
  * `singularity`: From `github.com/sylabs/singularity`, which is the fork by Sylabs Inc..

  `programs.singularity` got a new `package` option to specify which package to use.

  `singularity-tools.buildImage` got a new input argument `singularity` to specify which package to use.

- The new option `programs.singularity.enableFakeroot`, if set to `true`, provides `--fakeroot` support for `apptainer` and `singularity`.

- The `unifi-poller` package and corresponding NixOS module have been renamed to `unpoller` to match upstream.

- `protonmail-bridge` package has been updated to v3.0 and the CLI executable is now named bridge instead of protonmail-bridge to be more in line with upstream.

- The new option `services.tailscale.useRoutingFeatures` controls various settings for using Tailscale features like exit nodes and subnet routers. If you wish to use your machine as an exit node, you can set this setting to `server`, otherwise if you wish to use an exit node you can set this setting to `client`.
