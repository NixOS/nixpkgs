      The attribute name of the Radicale daemon has been changed from

    <para>
      The Yama LSM is now enabled by default in the kernel,
      which prevents ptracing non-child processes.
      This means you will not be able to attach gdb to an existing process,
      but will need to start that process from gdb (so it is a child).
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      The <literal>stripHash</literal> bash function in <literal>stdenv</literal>
      changed according to its documentation; it now outputs the stripped name to
      <literal>stdout</literal> instead of putting it in the variable
      <literal>strippedName</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>PHP now scans for extra configuration .ini files in /etc/php.d
    instead of /etc. This prevents accidentally loading non-PHP .ini files
    that may be in /etc.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Parsoid service now uses YAML configuration format.
     <literal>service.parsoid.interwikis</literal> is now called
     <literal>service.parsoid.wikis</literal> and is a list of either API URLs
     or attribute sets as specified in parsoid's documentation.
