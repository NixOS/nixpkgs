<para>When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the
following incompatible changes:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Cross compilation has been rewritten. See the nixpkgs manual for
      details. The most obvious breaking change is that derivations absent a
      <literal>.nativeDrv</literal> or <literal>.crossDrv</literal> are now
      cross by default, not native.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>stdenv.overrides</literal> is now expected to take <literal>self</literal>
      and <literal>super</literal> arguments. See <literal>lib.trivial.extends</literal>
      for what those parameters represent.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>gnome</literal> alias has been removed along with
      <literal>gtk</literal>, <literal>gtkmm</literal> and several others.
      Now you need to use versioned attributes, like <literal>gnome3</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      The attribute name of the Radicale daemon has been changed from
      <literal>pythonPackages.radicale</literal> to
      <literal>radicale</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      The Yama LSM is now enabled by default in the kernel,
      which prevents ptracing non-child processes.
      This means you will not be able to attach gdb to an existing process,
      but will need to start that process from gdb (so it is a child).
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      The <literal>stripHash</literal> bash function in <literal>stdenv</literal>
      changed according to its documentation; it now outputs the stripped name to
      <literal>stdout</literal> instead of putting it in the variable
      <literal>strippedName</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>PHP now scans for extra configuration .ini files in /etc/php.d
    instead of /etc. This prevents accidentally loading non-PHP .ini files
    that may be in /etc.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Parsoid service now uses YAML configuration format.
     <literal>service.parsoid.interwikis</literal> is now called
     <literal>service.parsoid.wikis</literal> and is a list of either API URLs
     or attribute sets as specified in parsoid's documentation.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
     <literal>Ntpd</literal> was replaced by
     <literal>systemd-timesyncd</literal> as the default service to synchronize
     system time with a remote NTP server. The old behavior can be restored by
     setting <literal>services.ntp.enable</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
     Upstream time servers for all NTP implementations are now configured using
     <literal>networking.timeServers</literal>.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para><literal>overridePackages</literal> function no longer exists.
    It is replaced by <link
    xlink:href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#sec-overlays-install">
    overlays</link>.  For example, the following code:

<programlisting>
  let
    pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {};
  in
    pkgs.overridePackages (self: super: ...)
</programlisting>

    should be replaced by:

<programlisting>
  let
    pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {};
  in
    import pkgs.path { overlays = [(self: super: ...)] }
</programlisting>

    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Autoloading connection tracking helpers is now disabled by default.
      This default was also changed in the Linux kernel and is considered
      insecure if not configured properly in your firewall. If you need
      connection tracking helpers (i.e. for active FTP) please enable
      <literal>networking.firewall.autoLoadConntrackHelpers</literal> and
      tune <literal>networking.firewall.connectionTrackingModules</literal>
      to suit your needs.
    </para>
  </listitem>

</itemizedlist>


<para>Other notable improvements:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Module type system have a new extensible option types feature that
      allow to extend certain types, such as enum, through multiple option
      declarations of the same option across multiple modules.
    </para>
