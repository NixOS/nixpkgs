## Highlights {#sec-release-24.05-highlights}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `amazonImage`, `amazonImageZfs`, `amazonImageAutomaticSize` has been removed from nixpkgs, this means effectively that no AMI will be published
  for this release by the release managers of 24.05 and further versions of NixOS. This has been done because our Amazon images receive actually very little
  maintenance and it has became a burden for the release management community to try to get someone involved. To re-introduce them, consider reverting the PRs
  and adding yourself as a maintainer and reaching out to the release management community.
