# Release 24.05 (“Uakari”, 2024.05/??) {#sec-release-24.05}

Support is planned until the end of December 2024, handing over to 24.11.

## Highlights {#sec-release-24.05-highlights}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `screen`'s module has been cleaned, and will now require you to set `programs.screen.enable` in order to populate `screenrc` and add the program to the environment.

- NixOS now installs a stub ELF loader that prints an informative error message when users attempt to run binaries not made for NixOS.
   - This can be disabled through the `environment.stub-ld.enable` option.
   - If you use `programs.nix-ld.enable`, no changes are needed. The stub will be disabled automatically.

- Julia environments can now be built with arbitrary packages from the ecosystem using the `.withPackages` function. For example: `julia.withPackages ["Plots"]`.

## New Services {#sec-release-24.05-new-services}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org), a functional package manager inspired by Nix. Available as [services.guix](#opt-services.guix.enable).

- [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot), a plugin-based Matrix bot framework. Available as [services.maubot](#opt-services.maubot.enable).

- [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/), a network software emulator. Available as [services.gns3-server](#opt-services.gns3-server.enable).

- [rspamd-trainer](https://gitlab.com/onlime/rspamd-trainer), script triggered by a helper which reads mails from a specific mail inbox and feeds them into rspamd for spam/ham training.

- [ollama](https://ollama.ai), server for running large language models locally.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-24.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The `power.ups` module now generates `upsd.conf`, `upsd.users` and `upsmon.conf` automatically from a set of new configuration options. This breaks compatibility with existing `power.ups` setups where these files were created manually. Back up these files before upgrading NixOS.

- `k9s` was updated to v0.30. There have been various breaking changes in the config file format,
  check out the changelog of [v0.29](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases/tag/v0.29.0) and
  [v0.30](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases/tag/v0.30.0) for details. It is recommended
  to back up your current configuration and let k9s recreate the new base configuration.

- `idris2` was updated to v0.7.0. This version introduces breaking changes. Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/blob/v0.7.0/CHANGELOG.md#v070) for details.

- `nitter` requires a `guest_accounts.jsonl` to be provided as a path or loaded into the default location at `/var/lib/nitter/guest_accounts.jsonl`. See [Guest Account Branch Deployment](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Guest-Account-Branch-Deployment) for details.

- Invidious has changed its default database username from `kemal` to `invidious`. Setups involving an externally provisioned database (i.e. `services.invidious.database.createLocally == false`) should adjust their configuration accordingly. The old `kemal` user will not be removed automatically even when the database is provisioned automatically.(https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/265857)

- `mkosi` was updated to v19. Parts of the user interface have changed. Consult the
  [release notes](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/releases/tag/v19) for a list of changes.

- The `kanata` package has been updated to v1.5.0, which includes [breaking changes](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v28 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud28`). The installation logic is as follows:
  - If [`services.nextcloud.package`](#opt-services.nextcloud.package) is specified explicitly, this package will be installed (**recommended**)
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=24.05, `pkgs.nextcloud28` will be installed by default.
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=23.11, `pkgs.nextcloud27` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v26 (or older) to v28 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud27` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud27;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).

- `services.resolved.fallbackDns` can now be used to disable the upstream fallback servers entirely by setting it to an empty list. To get the previous behaviour of the upstream defaults set it to null, the new default, instead.

- `services.avahi.nssmdns` got split into `services.avahi.nssmdns4` and `services.avahi.nssmdns6` which enable the mDNS NSS switch for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.
  Since most mDNS responders only register IPv4 addresses, most users want to keep the IPv6 support disabled to avoid long timeouts.

- `networking.iproute2.enable` now does not set `environment.etc."iproute2/rt_tables".text`.

  Setting `environment.etc."iproute2/{CONFIG_FILE_NAME}".text` will override the whole configuration file instead of appending it to the upstream configuration file.

  `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` includes `bpf_pinning`, `ematch_map`, `group`, `nl_protos`, `rt_dsfield`, `rt_protos`, `rt_realms`, `rt_scopes`, and `rt_tables`.

- The `systemd.oomd` module behavior is changed as:

  - Raise ManagedOOMMemoryPressureLimit from 50% to 80%. This should make systemd-oomd kill things less often, and fix issues like [this](https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/358).
    Reference: [commit](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/systemd/c/806c95e1c70af18f81d499b24cd7acfa4c36ffd6?branch=806c95e1c70af18f81d499b24cd7acfa4c36ffd6)

  - Remove swap policy. This helps prevent killing processes when user's swap is small.

  - Expand the memory pressure policy to system.slice, user-.slice, and all user owned slices. Reference: [commit](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/systemd/c/7665e1796f915dedbf8e014f0a78f4f576d609bb)

  - `systemd.oomd.enableUserServices` is renamed to `systemd.oomd.enableUserSlices`.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-24.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `addDriverRunpath` has been added to facilitate the deprecation of the old `addOpenGLRunpath` setuphook. This change is motivated by the evolution of the setuphook to include all hardware acceleration.

- Cinnamon has been updated to 6.0. Please beware that the [Wayland session](https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4591) is still experimental in this release.

- `services.postgresql.extraPlugins` changed its type from just a list of packages to also a function that returns such a list.
  For example a config line like ``services.postgresql.extraPlugins = with pkgs.postgresql_11.pkgs; [ postgis ];`` is recommended to be changed to ``services.postgresql.extraPlugins = ps: with ps; [ postgis ];``;

- Programs written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) are built with libraries selected by lockfiles.
  The `nimPackages` and `nim2Packages` sets have been removed.
  See https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable#nim for more information.

- [Portunus](https://github.com/majewsky/portunus) has been updated to 2.0.
  This version of Portunus supports strong password hashes, but the legacy hash SHA-256 is also still supported to ensure a smooth migration of existing user accounts.
  After upgrading, follow the instructions on the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/majewsky/portunus/releases/tag/v2.0.0) to upgrade all user accounts to strong password hashes.
  Support for weak password hashes will be removed in NixOS 24.11.

- `libass` now uses the native CoreText backend on Darwin, which may fix subtitle rendering issues with `mpv`, `ffmpeg`, etc.

- The following options of the Nextcloud module were moved into [`services.nextcloud.extraOptions`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions) and renamed to match the name from Nextcloud's `config.php`:
  - `logLevel` -> [`loglevel`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions.loglevel),
  - `logType` -> [`log_type`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions.log_type),
  - `defaultPhoneRegion` -> [`default_phone_region`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions.default_phone_region),
  - `overwriteProtocol` -> [`overwriteprotocol`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions.overwriteprotocol),
  - `skeletonDirectory` -> [`skeletondirectory`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions.skeletondirectory),
  - `globalProfiles` -> [`profile.enabled`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions._profile.enabled_),
  - `extraTrustedDomains` -> [`trusted_domains`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions.trusted_domains) and
  - `trustedProxies` -> [`trusted_proxies`](#opt-services.nextcloud.extraOptions.trusted_proxies).

- The Yama LSM is now enabled by default in the kernel, which prevents ptracing
  non-child processes. This means you will not be able to attach gdb to an
  existing process, but will need to start that process from gdb (so it is a
  child). Or you can set `boot.kernel.sysctl."kernel.yama.ptrace_scope"` to 0.

- [Nginx virtual hosts](#opt-services.nginx.virtualHosts) using `forceSSL` or
  `globalRedirect` can now have redirect codes other than 301 through
  `redirectCode`.

- The source of the `mockgen` package has changed to the [go.uber.org/mock](https://github.com/uber-go/mock) fork because [the original repository is no longer maintained](https://github.com/golang/mock#gomock).

- [](#opt-boot.kernel.sysctl._net.core.wmem_max_) changed from a string to an integer because of the addition of a custom merge option (taking the highest value defined to avoid conflicts between 2 services trying to set that value), just as [](#opt-boot.kernel.sysctl._net.core.rmem_max_) since 22.11.

- `services.zfs.zed.enableMail` now uses the global `sendmail` wrapper defined by an email module
  (such as msmtp or Postfix). It no longer requires using a special ZFS build with email support.

- Gitea 1.21 upgrade has several breaking changes, including:
  - Custom themes and other assets that were previously stored in `custom/public/*` now belong in `custom/public/assets/*`
  - New instances of Gitea using MySQL now ignore the `[database].CHARSET` config option and always use the `utf8mb4` charset, existing instances should migrate via the `gitea doctor convert` CLI command.

- The `hardware.pulseaudio` module now sets permission of pulse user home directory to 755 when running in "systemWide" mode. It fixes [issue 114399](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/114399).

- The `btrbk` module now automatically selects and provides required compression
  program depending on the configured `stream_compress` option. Since this
  replaces the need for the `extraPackages` option, this option will be
  deprecated in future releases.

- QtMultimedia has changed its default backend to `QT_MEDIA_BACKEND=ffmpeg` (previously `gstreamer` on Linux or `darwin` on MacOS).
  The previous native backends remain available but are now minimally maintained. Refer to [upstream documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtmultimedia-index.html#ffmpeg-as-the-default-backend) for further details about each platform.
