     The graphical installer image starts the graphical session automatically.
     Before you'd be greeted by a tty and asked to enter <command>systemctl start display-manager</command>.
     It is now possible to disable the display-manager from running by selecting the <literal>Disable display-manager</literal>
     quirk in the boot menu.

     <para>
       By default zfs pools will now be trimmed on a weekly basis.
       Trimming is only done on supported devices (i.e. NVME or SSDs)
       and should improve throughput and lifetime of these devices.
       It is controlled by the <varname>services.zfs.trim.enable</varname> varname.
       The zfs scrub service (<varname>services.zfs.autoScrub.enable</varname>)
       and the zfs autosnapshot service (<varname>services.zfs.autoSnapshot.enable</varname>)
       are now only enabled if zfs is set in <varname>config.boot.initrd.supportedFilesystems</varname> or
       <varname>config.boot.supportedFilesystems</varname>. These lists will automatically contain
       zfs as soon as any zfs mountpoint is configured in <varname>fileSystems</varname>.

      <command>nixos-option</command> has been rewritten in C++, speeding it up, improving correctness,
      and adding a <option>--all</option> option which prints all options and their values.

   incompatible changes:

    <para>
      GnuPG is now built without support for a graphical passphrase entry
      by default. Please enable the <literal>gpg-agent</literal> user service
      via the NixOS option <literal>programs.gnupg.agent.enable</literal>.
      Note that upstream recommends using <literal>gpg-agent</literal> and
      will spawn a <literal>gpg-agent</literal> on the first invocation of
      GnuPG anyway.

    <para>
     The <literal>dynamicHosts</literal> option has been removed from the
     <link linkend="opt-networking.networkmanager.enable">networkd</link>
     module. Allowing (multiple) regular users to override host entries
     affecting the whole system opens up a huge attack vector.
     There seem to be very rare cases where this might be useful.
     Consider setting system-wide host entries using
     <link linkend="opt-networking.hosts">networking.hosts</link>, provide
     them via the DNS server in your network, or use
     <link linkend="opt-environment.etc">environment.etc</link>
     to add a file into <literal>/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d</literal>
     reconfiguring <literal>hostsdir</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <literal>99-main.network</literal> file was removed. Maching all
      network interfaces caused many breakages, see
      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/18962">#18962</link>
        and <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/71106">#71106</link>.

    <para>
      We already don't support the global <link linkend="opt-networking.useDHCP">networking.useDHCP</link>,
      <link linkend="opt-networking.defaultGateway">networking.defaultGateway</link> and
      <link linkend="opt-networking.defaultGateway6">networking.defaultGateway6</link> options
      if <link linkend="opt-networking.useNetworkd">networking.useNetworkd</link> is enabled,
      but direct users to configure the per-device
      <link linkend="opt-networking.interfaces">networking.interfaces.&lt;name&gt;.…</link> options.
    </para>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      The stdenv now runs all bash with <literal>set -u</literal>, to catch the use of undefined variables.
      Before, it itself used <literal>set -u</literal> but was careful to unset it so other packages' code ran as before.
      Now, all bash code is held to the same high standard, and the rather complex stateful manipulation of the options can be discarded.
    </para>

    <para>
     The SLIM Display Manager has been removed, as it has been unmaintained since 2013.
     Consider migrating to a different display manager such as LightDM (current default in NixOS),
     SDDM, GDM, or using the startx module which uses Xinitrc.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The BEAM package set has been deleted. You will only find there the different interpreters.
      You should now use the different build tools coming with the languages with sandbox mode disabled.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There is now only one Xfce package-set and module. This means attributes, <literal>xfce4-14</literal>
     <literal>xfce4-12</literal>, and <literal>xfceUnstable</literal> all now point to the latest Xfce 4.14
     packages. And in future NixOS releases will be the latest released version of Xfce available at the
     time during the releases development (if viable).
    </para>

    <para>
      The <link linkend="opt-services.phpfpm.pools">phpfpm</link> module now sets
      <literal>PrivateTmp=true</literal> in its systemd units for better process isolation.
      If you rely on <literal>/tmp</literal> being shared with other services, explicitly override this by
      setting <literal>serviceConfig.PrivateTmp</literal> to <literal>false</literal> for each phpfpm unit.
    </para>

    <para>
     KDE’s old multimedia framework Phonon no longer supports Qt 4. For that reason, Plasma desktop also does not have <option>enableQt4Support</option> option any more.

     The BeeGFS module has been removed.

     The osquery module has been removed.

      Going forward, <literal>~/bin</literal> in the users home directory will no longer be in <literal>PATH</literal> by default.
      If you depend on this you should set the option <literal>environment.homeBinInPath</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
      The aforementioned option was added this release.
    </para>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <literal>buildRustCrate</literal> infrastructure now produces <literal>lib</literal> outputs in addition to the <literal>out</literal> output.
      This has led to drastically reduced closed sizes for some rust crates since development dependencies are now in the <literal>lib</literal> output.
