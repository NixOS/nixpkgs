- `pharo` has been updated to latest stable (PharoVM 10.0.5), which is compatible with the latest stable and oldstable images (Pharo 10 and 11). The VM in question is the 64bit Spur. The 32bit version has been dropped due to lack of maintenance. The Cog VM has been deleted because it is severily outdated. Finally, the `pharo-launcher` package has been deleted because it was not compatible with the newer VM, and due to lack of maintenance.
