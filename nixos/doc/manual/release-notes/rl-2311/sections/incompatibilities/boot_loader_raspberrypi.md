- The `boot.loader.raspberryPi` options have been marked deprecated, with intent for removal for NixOS 24.11. They had a limited use-case, and do not work like people expect. They required either very old installs ([before mid-2019](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/62462)) or customized builds out of scope of the standard and generic AArch64 support. That option set never supported the Raspberry Pi 4 family of devices.
