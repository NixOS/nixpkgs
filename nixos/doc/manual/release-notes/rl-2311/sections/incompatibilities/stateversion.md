- mdraid support is now optional. This reduces initramfs size and prevents the potentially undesired automatic detection and activation of software RAID pools. It is disabled by default in new configurations (determined by `stateVersion`), but the appropriate settings will be generated by `nixos-generate-config` when installing to a software RAID device, so the standard installation procedure should be unaffected. If you have custom configs relying on mdraid, ensure that you use `stateVersion` correctly or set `boot.swraid.enable` manually. On systems with an updated `stateVersion` we now also emit warnings if `mdadm.conf` does not contain the minimum required configuration necessary to run the dynamically enabled monitoring daemons.
