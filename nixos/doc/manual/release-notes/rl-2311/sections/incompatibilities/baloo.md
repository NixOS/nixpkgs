- `baloo`, the file indexer/search engine used by KDE now has a patch to prevent files from constantly being reindexed when the device ids of the their underlying storage changes. This happens frequently when using btrfs or LVM. The patch has not yet been accepted upstream but it provides a significantly improved experience. When upgrading, reset baloo to get a clean index: `balooctl disable ; balooctl purge ; balooctl enable`.
