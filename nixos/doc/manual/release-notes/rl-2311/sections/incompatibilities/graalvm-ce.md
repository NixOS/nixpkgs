- GraalVM has been updated to the latest version, and this brings significant changes. Upstream don't release multiple versions targeting different JVMs anymore, so now we only have one GraalVM derivation (`graalvm-ce`). While at first glance the version may seem a downgrade (22.3.1 -> 21.0.0), the major version is now following the JVM it targets (so this latest version targets JVM 21). Also some products like `llvm-installable-svm` and `native-image-svm` were incorporate to the main GraalVM derivation, so they're included by default.
