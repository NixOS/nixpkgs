- `netbox` was updated to 3.6. NixOS' `services.netbox.package` still defaults to 3.5 if `stateVersion` is earlier than 23.11. Please review upstream's breaking changes [for 3.6.0](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v3.6.0) and upgrade NetBox by changing `services.netbox.package`. Database migrations will be run automatically.
