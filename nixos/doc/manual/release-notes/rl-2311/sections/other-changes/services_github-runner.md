- `services.github-runner` / `services.github-runners.<name>` gained the option `nodeRuntimes`. The option defaults to `[ "node20" ]`, i.e., the service supports Node.js 20 GitHub Actions only. The list of Node.js versions accepted by `nodeRuntimes` tracks the versions the upstream GitHub Actions runner supports. See [#249103](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/249103) for details.
