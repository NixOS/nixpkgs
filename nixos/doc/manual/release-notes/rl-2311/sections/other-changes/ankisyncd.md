- The module [services.ankisyncd](#opt-services.ankisyncd.package) has been switched to [anki-sync-server-rs](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server-rs) from the old python version, which was difficult to update, had not been updated in a while, and did not support recent versions of anki.
Unfortunately all servers supporting new clients (newer version of anki-sync-server, anki's built in sync server and this new rust package) do not support the older sync protocol that was used in the old server, so such old clients will also need updating and in particular the anki package in nixpkgs is also being updated in this release.
The module update takes care of the new config syntax and the data itself (user login and cards) are compatible, so users of the module will be able to just log in again after updating both client and server without any extra action.
