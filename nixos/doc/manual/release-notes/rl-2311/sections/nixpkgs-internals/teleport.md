- `teleport` has been upgraded from major version 12 to major version 14. Please see upstream [upgrade instructions](https://goteleport.com/docs/management/operations/upgrading/) and release notes for versions [13](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1300-050823) and [14](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1400-092023). Note that Teleport does not officially support upgrades across more than one major version at a time. If you're running Teleport server components, it is recommended to first upgrade to an intermediate 13.x version by setting `services.teleport.package = pkgs.teleport_13`. Afterwards, this option can be removed to upgrade to the default version (14).
