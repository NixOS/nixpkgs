      MariaDB has been updated to 10.4, MariaDB Galera to 26.4.
      Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database.
      For MariaDB Galera Cluster, see <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-103-to-mariadb-104-with-galera-cluster/">Upgrading
      from MariaDB 10.3 to MariaDB 10.4 with Galera Cluster</link> instead.
      Before doing the upgrade read <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-103-to-mariadb-104/#incompatible-changes-between-103-and-104">Incompatible
      Changes Between 10.3 and 10.4</link>.
      After the upgrade you will need to run <literal>mysql_upgrade</literal>.
      MariaDB 10.4 introduces a number of changes to the authentication process, intended to make things easier and more
      intuitive. See <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/authentication-from-mariadb-104/">Authentication from MariaDB 10.4</link>.
      unix_socket auth plugin does not use a password, and uses the connecting user's UID instead. When a new MariaDB data directory is initialized, two MariaDB users are
      created and can be used with new unix_socket auth plugin, as well as traditional mysql_native_password plugin: root@localhost and mysql@localhost. To actually use
      the traditional mysql_native_password plugin method, one must run the following:
<programlisting>
services.mysql.initialScript = pkgs.writeText "mariadb-init.sql" ''
  ALTER USER root@localhost IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING PASSWORD("verysecret");
'';
</programlisting>
      When MariaDB data directory is just upgraded (not initialized), the users are not created or modified.

      MySQL server is now started with additional systemd sandbox/hardening options for better security. The PrivateTmp, ProtectHome, and ProtectSystem options
      may be problematic when MySQL is attempting to read from or write to your filesystem anywhere outside of its own state directory, for example when
      calling <literal>LOAD DATA INFILE or SELECT * INTO OUTFILE</literal>. In this scenario a variant of the following may be required:
        - allow MySQL to read from /home and /tmp directories when using <literal>LOAD DATA INFILE</literal>
<programlisting>
systemd.services.mysql.serviceConfig.ProtectHome = lib.mkForce "read-only";
</programlisting>
        - allow MySQL to write to custom folder <literal>/var/data</literal> when using <literal>SELECT * INTO OUTFILE</literal>, assuming the mysql user has write
          access to <literal>/var/data</literal>
<programlisting>
systemd.services.mysql.serviceConfig.ReadWritePaths = [ "/var/data" ];
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      The MySQL service no longer runs its <literal>systemd</literal> service startup script as <literal>root</literal> anymore. A dedicated non <literal>root</literal>
      super user account is required for operation. This means users with an existing MySQL or MariaDB database server are required to run the following SQL statements
      as a super admin user before upgrading:
<programlisting>
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'mysql'@'localhost' identified with unix_socket;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mysql'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
</programlisting>
      If you use MySQL instead of MariaDB please replace <literal>unix_socket</literal> with <literal>auth_socket</literal>. If you have changed the value of <xref linkend="opt-services.mysql.user"/>
      from the default of <literal>mysql</literal> to a different user please change <literal>'mysql'@'localhost'</literal> to the corresponding user instead.

      like <command>whatis</command> and <command>apropos</command>. The caches are generated during the build of
      the NixOS configuration: since this can be expensive when a large number of packages are installed, the
      feature is disabled by default.

      Zabbix now defaults to 5.0, updated from 4.4. Please carefully read through
      <link xlink:href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/installation/upgrade/sources">the upgrade guide</link>
      and apply any changes required. Be sure to take special note of the section on

      If you are using Zabbix Server with a MySQL or MariaDB database you should note that using a character set of <literal>utf8</literal> and a collate of <literal>utf8_bin</literal> has become mandatory with
      this release. See the upstream <link xlink:href="https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-17357">issue</link> for further discussion. Before upgrading you should check the character set and collation used by
      your database and ensure they are correct:
<programlisting>
  SELECT
    default_character_set_name,
    default_collation_name
  FROM
    information_schema.schemata
  WHERE
    schema_name = 'zabbix';
</programlisting>
      If these values are not correct you should take a backup of your database and convert the character set and collation as required. Here is an
      <link xlink:href="https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-help/396573-reinstall-after-upgrade?p=396891#post396891">example</link> of how to do so, taken from
      the Zabbix forums:
<programlisting>
  ALTER DATABASE `zabbix` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;

  -- the following will produce a list of SQL commands you should subsequently execute
  SELECT CONCAT("ALTER TABLE ", TABLE_NAME," CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;") AS ExecuteTheString
  FROM information_schema.`COLUMNS`
  WHERE table_schema = "zabbix" AND COLLATION_NAME = "utf8_general_ci";

      The NixOS module system now supports freeform modules as a mix between <literal>types.attrsOf</literal> and <literal>types.submodule</literal>.

       Since this release there's an easy way to customize your PHP
       install to get a much smaller base PHP with only wanted
       extensions enabled. See the following snippet installing a
       smaller PHP with the extensions <literal>imagick</literal>,
       <literal>opcache</literal>, <literal>pdo</literal> and
       <literal>pdo_mysql</literal> loaded:

       <programlisting>
environment.systemPackages = [
  (pkgs.php.withExtensions
    ({ all, ... }: with all; [
      imagick
      opcache
      pdo
      pdo_mysql
    ])
  )
];</programlisting>

       The default <literal>php</literal> attribute hasn't lost any
       extensions. The <literal>opcache</literal> extension has been
       added.

       All upstream PHP extensions are available under <package><![CDATA[php.extensions.<name?>]]></package>.

       In addition to the hostname, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN),

     The GRUB specific option <option>boot.loader.grub.extraInitrd</option>

     it is not possible to directly boot an older generation that used that

     The scripted networking system now uses <literal>.link</literal> files in

     Bringing the interface up has been moved to the beginning of the
     <literal>network-addresses-*</literal> unit.
     Note this doesn't require <command>systemd-networkd</command> - it's udev that
     parses <literal>.link</literal> files.
     Extra care needs to be taken in the presence of <link xlink:href="https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkInterfaceNames#THE_.22PERSISTENT_NAMES.22_SCHEME">legacy udev rules</link>
     to rename interfaces, as MAC Address and MTU defined in these options can only match on the original link name.
     In such cases, you most likely want to create a <literal>10-*.link</literal> file through <xref linkend="opt-systemd.network.links"/> and set both name and MAC Address / MTU there.

     Since the actual memory requirements depend on hardware, timing, exact

     overrun</literal> spam and increase the memory limit as they see fit.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note: Increasing the <literal>ReceiveBufferSize=</literal> doesn't allocate any memory. It just increases
     the upper bound on the kernel side. The memory allocation depends on the amount of messages that are
     queued on the kernel side of the netlink socket.
