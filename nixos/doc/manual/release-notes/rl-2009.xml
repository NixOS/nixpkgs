      MariaDB has been updated to 10.4, MariaDB Galera to 26.4.
      Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database.
      For MariaDB Galera Cluster, see <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-103-to-mariadb-104-with-galera-cluster/">Upgrading
      from MariaDB 10.3 to MariaDB 10.4 with Galera Cluster</link> instead.
      Before doing the upgrade read <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-103-to-mariadb-104/#incompatible-changes-between-103-and-104">Incompatible
      Changes Between 10.3 and 10.4</link>.
      After the upgrade you will need to run <literal>mysql_upgrade</literal>.
      MariaDB 10.4 introduces a number of changes to the authentication process, intended to make things easier and more
      intuitive. See <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/authentication-from-mariadb-104/">Authentication from MariaDB 10.4</link>.
      unix_socket auth plugin does not use a password, and uses the connecting user's UID instead. When a new MariaDB data directory is initialized, two MariaDB users are
      created and can be used with new unix_socket auth plugin, as well as traditional mysql_native_password plugin: root@localhost and mysql@localhost. To actually use
      the traditional mysql_native_password plugin method, one must run the following:
<programlisting>
services.mysql.initialScript = pkgs.writeText "mariadb-init.sql" ''
  ALTER USER root@localhost IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING PASSWORD("verysecret");
'';
</programlisting>
      When MariaDB data directory is just upgraded (not initialized), the users are not created or modified.

     proxy protocol</link>. This storage format is simpler and therefore less
     likekly to break with future versions of go. As a result
     <literal>buildGoModule</literal> switched from
     <literal>modSha256</literal> to the <literal>vendorSha256</literal>
     attribute to pin fetched version data. <literal>buildGoModule</literal>

     least one pre-generated key must be specified.

    <para>
     If you used the <option>boot.initrd.network.ssh.host*Key</option>
     options, you'll get an error explaining how to convert your host

       Since this release there's an easy way to customize your PHP
       install to get a much smaller base PHP with only wanted
       extensions enabled. See the following snippet installing a
       smaller PHP with the extensions <literal>imagick</literal>,
       <literal>opcache</literal>, <literal>pdo</literal> and
       <literal>pdo_mysql</literal> loaded:

       <programlisting>
environment.systemPackages = [
  (pkgs.php.withExtensions
    ({ all, ... }: with all; [
      imagick
      opcache
      pdo
      pdo_mysql
    ])
  )
];</programlisting>

       The default <literal>php</literal> attribute hasn't lost any
       extensions. The <literal>opcache</literal> extension has been
       added.

       All upstream PHP extensions are available under <package><![CDATA[php.extensions.<name?>]]></package>.

             The updated <literal>php</literal> attribute is now easily
             customizable to your liking by using
             <literal>php.withExtensions</literal> or
             <literal>php.buildEnv</literal> instead of writing config files

             The remaining configuration flags can now be set directly on

php.override {
  config.php.embed = true;
  config.php.apxs2 = false;
}
             </programlisting>

             you should now write

     The httpd web server previously started its main process as root

     This was changed to start all of httpd as a less privileged user (defined by
     <xref linkend="opt-services.httpd.user"/> and
     <xref linkend="opt-services.httpd.group"/>). As a consequence, all files that

       In addition to the hostname, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN),

       <literal>${cfg.domain}</literal> is now added to
       <literal>/etc/hosts</literal>, to allow local FQDN resolution, as used by the
       <literal>hostname --fqdn</literal> command and other applications that
       try to determine the FQDN. These new entries take precedence over entries
       from the DNS which could cause regressions in some very specific setups.
       Additionally the hostname is now resolved to <literal>127.0.0.2</literal>
       instead of <literal>127.0.1.1</literal> to be consistent with what
       <literal>nss-myhostname</literal> (from systemd) returns.

       The hostname (<literal>networking.hostName</literal>) must now be a valid

       This means that the hostname must start with a letter, end with a letter
       or digit, and have as interior characters only letters, digits, and
       hyphen. The maximum length is 63 characters. Additionally it is
       recommended to only use lower-case characters.

     The GRUB specific option <option>boot.loader.grub.extraInitrd</option>
     has been replaced with the generic option
     <option>boot.initrd.secrets</option>. This option creates a secondary
     initrd from the specified files, rather than using a manually created
     initrd file.

     Due to an existing bug with <option>boot.loader.grub.extraInitrd</option>,
     it is not possible to directly boot an older generation that used that
     option. It is still possible to rollback to that generation if the required
     initrd file has not been deleted.

     The scripted networking system now uses <literal>.link</literal> files in
     <literal>/etc/systemd/network</literal> to configure mac address and link MTU,
     instead of the sometimes buggy <literal>network-link-*</literal> units, which
     have been removed.
     Bringing the interface up has been moved to the beginning of the
     <literal>network-addresses-*</literal> unit.
     Note this doesn't require <command>systemd-networkd</command> - it's udev that
     parses <literal>.link</literal> files.
     Extra care needs to be taken in the presence of <link xlink:href="https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkInterfaceNames#THE_.22PERSISTENT_NAMES.22_SCHEME">legacy udev rules</link>
     to rename interfaces, as MAC Address and MTU defined in these options can only match on the original link name.
     In such cases, you most likely want to create a <literal>10-*.link</literal> file through <xref linkend="opt-systemd.network.links"/> and set both name and MAC Address / MTU there.
