      MariaDB has been updated to 10.4, MariaDB Galera to 26.4.
      Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database.
      For MariaDB Galera Cluster, see <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-103-to-mariadb-104-with-galera-cluster/">Upgrading
      from MariaDB 10.3 to MariaDB 10.4 with Galera Cluster</link> instead.
      Before doing the upgrade read <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-103-to-mariadb-104/#incompatible-changes-between-103-and-104">Incompatible
      Changes Between 10.3 and 10.4</link>.
      After the upgrade you will need to run <literal>mysql_upgrade</literal>.
      MariaDB 10.4 introduces a number of changes to the authentication process, intended to make things easier and more
      intuitive. See <link xlink:href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/authentication-from-mariadb-104/">Authentication from MariaDB 10.4</link>.
      unix_socket auth plugin does not use a password, and uses the connecting user's UID instead. When a new MariaDB data directory is initialized, two MariaDB users are
      created and can be used with new unix_socket auth plugin, as well as traditional mysql_native_password plugin: root@localhost and mysql@localhost. To actually use
      the traditional mysql_native_password plugin method, one must run the following:
<programlisting>
services.mysql.initialScript = pkgs.writeText "mariadb-init.sql" ''
  ALTER USER root@localhost IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING PASSWORD("verysecret");
'';
</programlisting>
      When MariaDB data directory is just upgraded (not initialized), the users are not created or modified.

      MySQL server is now started with additional systemd sandbox/hardening options for better security. The PrivateTmp, ProtectHome, and ProtectSystem options
      may be problematic when MySQL is attempting to read from or write to your filesystem anywhere outside of its own state directory, for example when
      calling <literal>LOAD DATA INFILE or SELECT * INTO OUTFILE</literal>. In this scenario a variant of the following may be required:
        - allow MySQL to read from /home and /tmp directories when using <literal>LOAD DATA INFILE</literal>
<programlisting>
systemd.services.mysql.serviceConfig.ProtectHome = lib.mkForce "read-only";
</programlisting>
        - allow MySQL to write to custom folder <literal>/var/data</literal> when using <literal>SELECT * INTO OUTFILE</literal>, assuming the mysql user has write
          access to <literal>/var/data</literal>
<programlisting>
systemd.services.mysql.serviceConfig.ReadWritePaths = [ "/var/data" ];

      Two new option <link linkend="opt-documentation.man.generateCaches">documentation.man.generateCaches</link>
      has been added to automatically generate the <literal>man-db</literal> caches, which are needed by utilities
      like <command>whatis</command> and <command>apropos</command>. The caches are generated during the build of
      the NixOS configuration: since this can be expensive when a large number of packages are installed, the
      feature is disabled by default.

     <literal>buildGoModule</literal> now internally creates a vendor directory
     in the source tree for downloaded modules instead of using go's <link
     xlink:href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_proxy_protocol">module
     proxy protocol</link>. This storage format is simpler and therefore less
     likekly to break with future versions of go. As a result
     <literal>buildGoModule</literal> switched from
     <literal>modSha256</literal> to the <literal>vendorSha256</literal>
     attribute to pin fetched version data. <literal>buildGoModule</literal>

     The initrd SSH support now uses OpenSSH rather than Dropbear to
     allow the use of Ed25519 keys and other OpenSSH-specific
     functionality. Host keys must now be in the OpenSSH format, and at
     least one pre-generated key must be specified.

    <para>
     If you used the <option>boot.initrd.network.ssh.host*Key</option>
     options, you'll get an error explaining how to convert your host
     keys and migrate to the new
     <option>boot.initrd.network.ssh.hostKeys</option> option.
     Otherwise, if you don't have any host keys set, you'll need to

       Since this release there's an easy way to customize your PHP
       install to get a much smaller base PHP with only wanted
       extensions enabled. See the following snippet installing a
       smaller PHP with the extensions <literal>imagick</literal>,
       <literal>opcache</literal>, <literal>pdo</literal> and
       <literal>pdo_mysql</literal> loaded:

       <programlisting>
environment.systemPackages = [
  (pkgs.php.withExtensions
    ({ all, ... }: with all; [
      imagick
      opcache
      pdo
      pdo_mysql
    ])
  )
];</programlisting>

       The default <literal>php</literal> attribute hasn't lost any
       extensions. The <literal>opcache</literal> extension has been
       added.

       All upstream PHP extensions are available under <package><![CDATA[php.extensions.<name?>]]></package>.

             The updated <literal>php</literal> attribute is now easily
             customizable to your liking by using
             <literal>php.withExtensions</literal> or
             <literal>php.buildEnv</literal> instead of writing config files
             or changing configure flags.

php.override {
  config.php.embed = true;
  config.php.apxs2 = false;
}
             </programlisting>

             you should now write

     <xref linkend="opt-services.httpd.group"/>). As a consequence, all files that

       In addition to the hostname, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN),

       This means that the hostname must start with a letter, end with a letter
       or digit, and have as interior characters only letters, digits, and
       hyphen. The maximum length is 63 characters. Additionally it is

     The GRUB specific option <option>boot.loader.grub.extraInitrd</option>
     has been replaced with the generic option
     <option>boot.initrd.secrets</option>. This option creates a secondary
     initrd from the specified files, rather than using a manually created
     initrd file.

     Due to an existing bug with <option>boot.loader.grub.extraInitrd</option>,
     it is not possible to directly boot an older generation that used that
     option. It is still possible to rollback to that generation if the required
     initrd file has not been deleted.

     Radicale's default package has changed from 2.x to 3.x. An upgrade
     checklist can be found
     <link xlink:href="https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/blob/3.0.x/NEWS.md#upgrade-checklist">here</link>.
     You can use the newer version in the NixOS service by setting the

     Please note that Rust packages utilizing a custom build/install procedure
     (e.g. by using a <filename>Makefile</filename>) or test suites that rely on the
     structure of the <filename>target/</filename> directory may break due to those assumptions.
     For further information, please read the Rust section in the Nixpkgs manual.

     The scripted networking system now uses <literal>.link</literal> files in
     <literal>/etc/systemd/network</literal> to configure mac address and link MTU,
     instead of the sometimes buggy <literal>network-link-*</literal> units, which
     have been removed.
     Bringing the interface up has been moved to the beginning of the
     <literal>network-addresses-*</literal> unit.
     Note this doesn't require <command>systemd-networkd</command> - it's udev that
     parses <literal>.link</literal> files.
     Extra care needs to be taken in the presence of <link xlink:href="https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkInterfaceNames#THE_.22PERSISTENT_NAMES.22_SCHEME">legacy udev rules</link>
     to rename interfaces, as MAC Address and MTU defined in these options can only match on the original link name.
     In such cases, you most likely want to create a <literal>10-*.link</literal> file through <xref linkend="opt-systemd.network.links"/> and set both name and MAC Address / MTU there.

     With this release <literal>systemd-networkd</literal> (when enabled through <xref linkend="opt-networking.useNetworkd"/>)
     has it's netlink socket created through a <literal>systemd.socket</literal> unit. This gives us control over
     socket buffer sizes and other parameters. For larger setups where networkd has to create a lot of (virtual)
     devices the default buffer size (currently 128MB) is not enough.
    </para>
    <para>
     On a machine with &gt;100 virtual interfaces (e.g., wireguard tunnels, VLANs, …), that all have to
     be brought up during system startup, the receive buffer size will spike for a brief period.
     Eventually some of the message will be dropped since there is not enough (permitted) buffer
     space available.
    </para>
    <para>
     By having <literal>systemd-networkd</literal> start with a netlink socket created by
     <literal>systemd</literal> we can configure the <literal>ReceiveBufferSize=</literal> parameter
     in the socket options (i.e. <literal>systemd.sockets.systemd-networkd.socketOptions.ReceiveBufferSize</literal>)
     without recompiling <literal>systemd-networkd</literal>.

     Since the actual memory requirements depend on hardware, timing, exact
     configurations etc. it isn't currently possible to infer a good default
     from within the NixOS module system. Administrators are advised to
     monitor the logs of <literal>systemd-networkd</literal> for <literal>rtnl: kernel receive buffer
     overrun</literal> spam and increase the memory limit as they see fit.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note: Increasing the <literal>ReceiveBufferSize=</literal> doesn't allocate any memory. It just increases
     the upper bound on the kernel side. The memory allocation depends on the amount of messages that are
     queued on the kernel side of the netlink socket.
