<title>Backward Incompatibilities</title>

<para>When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the
following incompatible changes:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Dollar signs in options under <option>services.postfix</option> are
      passed verbatim to Postfix, which will interpret them as the beginning of
      a parameter expression. This was already true for string-valued options
      in the previous release, but not for list-valued options. If you need to
      pass literal dollar signs through Postfix, double them.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The <literal>postage</literal> package (for web-based PostgreSQL
      administration) has been renamed to <literal>pgmanage</literal>. The
      corresponding module has also been renamed. To migrate please rename all
      <option>services.postage</option> options to
      <option>services.pgmanage</option>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">
        The OpenSSH service no longer enables support for DSA keys by default,
        which could cause a system lock out. Update your keys or, unfavorably,
        re-enable DSA support manually.
      </emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
      DSA support was
      <link xlink:href="https://www.openssh.com/legacy.html">deprecated in OpenSSH 7.0</link>,
      due to it being too weak. To re-enable support, add
      <literal>PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss</literal> to the end of your
      <option>services.openssh.extraConfig</option>.
    </para>

    <para>
      After updating the keys to be stronger, anyone still on a pre-17.03
      version is safe to jump to 17.03, as vetted

  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>cc-wrapper</literal> has been split in two; there is now also a <literal>bintools-wrapper</literal>.
      The most commonly used files in <filename>nix-support</filename> are now split between the two wrappers.
      Some commonly used ones, like <filename>nix-support/dynamic-linker</filename>, are duplicated for backwards compatability, even though they rightly belong only in <literal>bintools-wrapper</literal>.
      Other more obscure ones are just moved.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The propagation logic has been changed.
      The new logic, along with new types of dependencies that go with, is thoroughly documented in the "Specifying dependencies" section of the "Standard Environment" chapter of the nixpkgs manual.
      <!-- That's <xref linkend="ssec-stdenv-attributes"> were we to merge the manuals. -->
      The old logic isn't but is easy to describe: dependencies were propagated as the same type of dependency no matter what.
      In practice, that means that many <function>propagatedNativeBuildInputs</function> should instead be  <function>propagatedBuildInputs</function>.
      Thankfully, that was and is the least used type of dependency.
      Also, it means that some <function>propagatedBuildInputs</function> should instead be <function>depsTargetTargetPropagated</function>.
      Other types dependencies should be unaffected.

    <para>
      <literal>lib.addPassthru</literal> is removed.  Use <literal>lib.extendDerivation true</literal> instead.  <emphasis role="strong">TODO: actually remove it before branching 18.03 off.</emphasis>

    <para>
      The <literal>memcached</literal> service no longer accept dynamic socket
      paths via <option>services.memcached.socket</option>. Unix sockets can be
      still enabled by <option>services.memcached.enableUnixSocket</option> and
      will be accessible at <literal>/run/memcached/memcached.sock</literal>.
    </para>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      The <varname>hardware.amdHybridGraphics.disable</varname> option was removed for lack of a maintainer. If you still need this module, you may wish to include a copy of it from an older version of nixos in your imports.

<title>Other Notable Changes</title>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      ZNC option <option>services.znc.mutable</option> now defaults to
      <literal>true</literal>. That means that old configuration is not
      overwritten by default when update to the znc options are made.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The option <option>networking.wireless.networks.&lt;name&gt;.auth</option>
      has been added for wireless networks with WPA-Enterprise authentication.
      There is also a new <option>extraConfig</option> option to directly
      configure <literal>wpa_supplicant</literal> and <option>hidden</option>
      to connect to hidden networks.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The option <option>services.xserver.desktopManager.default</option> is now <literal>none</literal> by default.
      An assertion failure is thrown if WM's and DM's default are <literal>none</literal>.
      To explicitly run a plain X session without and DM or WM, the newly introduced option <option>services.xserver.plainX</option>
      must be set to true.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The option <option>services.logstash.listenAddress</option> is now <literal>127.0.0.1</literal> by default.
      Previously the default behaviour was to listen on all interfaces.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>services.btrfs.autoScrub</literal> has been added, to
      periodically check btrfs filesystems for data corruption.
      If there's a correct copy available, it will automatically repair
      corrupted blocks.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>displayManager.lightdm.greeters.gtk.clock-format.</literal>
      has been added, the clock format string (as expected by
      strftime, e.g. <literal>%H:%M</literal>) to use with the lightdm
      gtk greeter panel.
    </para>
    <para>
      If set to null the default clock format is used.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>displayManager.lightdm.greeters.gtk.indicators</literal>
      has been added, a list of allowed indicator modules to use with
      the lightdm gtk greeter panel.
    </para>
    <para>
      Built-in indicators include <literal>~a11y</literal>,
      <literal>~language</literal>, <literal>~session</literal>,
      <literal>~power</literal>, <literal>~clock</literal>,
      <literal>~host</literal>, <literal>~spacer</literal>. Unity
      indicators can be represented by short name
      (e.g. <literal>sound</literal>, <literal>power</literal>),
      service file name, or absolute path.
    </para>
    <para>
      If set to <literal>null</literal> the default indicators are
      used.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order to have the previous default configuration add
<programlisting>
  services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.greeters.gtk.indicators = [
    "~host" "~spacer"
    "~clock" "~spacer"
    "~session"
    "~language"
    "~a11y"

  ];
</programlisting>
      to your <literal>configuration.nix</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The NixOS test driver supports user services declared by <literal>systemd.user.services</literal>.
      The methods <literal>waitForUnit</literal>, <literal>getUnitInfo</literal>, <literal>startJob</literal>
      and <literal>stopJob</literal> provide an optional <literal>$user</literal> argument for that purpose.
