following incompatible changes:</para>

    <para>
      Dollar signs in options under <option>services.postfix</option> are
      passed verbatim to Postfix, which will interpret them as the beginning of
      a parameter expression. This was already true for string-valued options
      in the previous release, but not for list-valued options. If you need to
      pass literal dollar signs through Postfix, double them.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The <literal>postage</literal> package (for web-based PostgreSQL
      administration) has been renamed to <literal>pgmanage</literal>. The
      corresponding module has also been renamed. To migrate please rename all
      <option>services.postage</option> options to
      <option>services.pgmanage</option>.

      <emphasis role="strong">
        The OpenSSH service no longer enables support for DSA keys by default,
        which could cause a system lock out. Update your keys or, unfavorably,
        re-enable DSA support manually.
      </emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
      DSA support was
      <link xlink:href="https://www.openssh.com/legacy.html">deprecated in OpenSSH 7.0</link>,
      due to it being too weak. To re-enable support, add
      <literal>PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss</literal> to the end of your
      <option>services.openssh.extraConfig</option>.
    </para>

    <para>
      After updating the keys to be stronger, anyone still on a pre-17.03
      version is safe to jump to 17.03, as vetted

<title>Other Notable Changes</title>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      ZNC option <option>services.znc.mutable</option> now defaults to
      <literal>true</literal>. That means that old configuration is not
      overwritten by default when update to the znc options are made.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The option <option>networking.wireless.networks.&lt;name&gt;.auth</option>
      has been added for wireless networks with WPA-Enterprise authentication.
      There is also a new <option>extraConfig</option> option to directly
      configure <literal>wpa_supplicant</literal> and <option>hidden</option>
      to connect to hidden networks.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The option <option>services.xserver.desktopManager.default</option> is now <literal>none</literal> by default.
      An assertion failure is thrown if WM's and DM's default are <literal>none</literal>.
      To explicitly run a plain X session without and DM or WM, the newly introduced option <option>services.xserver.plainX</option>
      must be set to true.
