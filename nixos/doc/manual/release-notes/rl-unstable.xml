following incompatible changes:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Steam now doesn't need root rights to work. Instead of using
<literal>*-steam-chrootenv</literal>, you should now just run <literal>steam</literal>.
<literal>steamChrootEnv</literal> package was renamed to <literal>steam</literal>,
and old <literal>steam</literal> package -- to <literal>steamOriginal</literal>.
</para></listitem>

        The default <literal>NIX_PATH</literal> for NixOS now includes
        <literal>/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels</literal>, so it's
        easy to add custom channels.
    </para>
    <para>
        Moreover, whenever a <command>nixos-rebuild &lt;action&gt;
        --upgrade</command> is issued, every channel that includes a file
        called <filename>.update-on-nixos-rebuild</filename> will be upgraded
        alongside of the <literal>nixos</literal> channel.
    </para>

	The CUPS printing service has been updated to version <literal>2.0.2</literal>.
