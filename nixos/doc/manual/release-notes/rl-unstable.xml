following incompatible changes:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Steam now doesn't need root rights to work. Instead of using
<literal>*-steam-chrootenv</literal>, you should now just run <literal>steam</literal>.
<literal>steamChrootEnv</literal> package was renamed to <literal>steam</literal>,
and old <literal>steam</literal> package -- to <literal>steamOriginal</literal>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>CMPlayer has been renamed to bomi upstream. Package <literal>cmplayer</literal>
was accordingly renamed to <literal>bomi</literal>
</para></listitem>

<listitem>
    <para>
        The default <literal>NIX_PATH</literal> for NixOS now includes
        <literal>/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels</literal>, so it's
        easy to add custom channels.
    </para>
    <para>
        Moreover, whenever a <command>nixos-rebuild &lt;action&gt;
        --upgrade</command> is issued, every channel that includes a file
        called <filename>.update-on-nixos-rebuild</filename> will be upgraded
        alongside of the <literal>nixos</literal> channel.
    </para>
</listitem>

<listitem>Elm has been updated to v0.15, bringing significant
changes. <literal>elm-server</literal> has been replaced by
<literal>elm-reactor</literal>; <literal>elm-get</literal> by
<literal>elm-package</literal>; and <literal>elm-package</literal> now
contains the standalone <literal>elm</literal> command. See the
announcements for Elm <link xlink:href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.14.elm">v0.14</link>
and <link xlink:href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.15.elm">v0.15</link>
