# Release 22.11 (“Raccoon”, 2022.11/??) {#sec-release-22.11}

Support is planned until the end of June 2023, handing over to 23.05.

## Highlights {#sec-release-22.11-highlights}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

- During cross-compilation, tests are now executed if the test suite can be executed
  by the build platform. This is the case when doing “native” cross-compilation
  where the build and host platforms are largely the same, but the nixpkgs' cross
  compilation infrastructure is used, e.g. `pkgsStatic` and `pkgsLLVM`. Another
  possibility is that the build platform is a superset of the host platform, e.g. when
  cross-compiling from `x86_64-unknown-linux` to `i686-unknown-linux`.
  The predicate gating test suite execution is the newly added `canExecute`
  predicate: You can e.g. check if `stdenv.buildPlatform` can execute binaries
  built for `stdenv.hostPlatform` (i.e. produced by `stdenv.cc`) by evaluating
  `stdenv.buildPlatform.canExecute stdenv.hostPlatform`.

- PHP now defaults to PHP 8.1, updated from 8.0.

- The NixOS module system now has a type `secretFile` for options which contain
  the path to a file that should remain secret. This is to avoid mistakes where
  one writes `services.miniflux.adminCredentialsFile = /etc/secret` instead of
  `services.miniflux.adminCredentialsFile = "/etc/secret";` which makes nix
  copy `/etc/secret` to the store where everyone could read it. A number of
  modules have been converted to use it. This is a breaking change visible by
  an error message like this:
  ```
  error: A definition for option `services.miniflux.adminCredentialsFile' is not of type `quoted path to a secret file'. Definition values:
       - In `nixos/lib/build-vms.nix': /etc/secret
  ```
  To fix the issue you must assess whether leaking `/etc/secret` to the store
  and thus all local users is a problem. If it is the case, then add quotes:
  `services.miniflux.adminCredentialsFile = "/etc/secrets"`. If you notice this
  during upgrade, your secret probably has already leaked and it may be a good
  time to change it. If leaking this file is acceptable (for example in a NixOS
  test), you can keep the old behavior like this:
  `services.miniflux.adminCredentialsFile = lib.types.secretFile.makeWorldReadable /etc/secret`.

## New Services {#sec-release-22.11-new-services}

- [appvm](https://github.com/jollheef/appvm), Nix based app VMs. Available as [virtualisation.appvm](options.html#opt-virtualisation.appvm.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-22.11-incompatibilities}

- The `isCompatible` predicate checking CPU compatibility is no longer exposed
  by the platform sets generated using `lib.systems.elaborate`. In most cases
  you will want to use the new `canExecute` predicate instead which also
  considers the kernel / syscall interface. It is briefly described in the
  release's [highlights section](#sec-release-22.11-highlights).
  `lib.systems.parse.isCompatible` still exists, but has changed semantically:
  Architectures with differing endianness modes are *no longer considered compatible*.

- The `isPowerPC` predicate, found on `platform` attrsets (`hostPlatform`, `buildPlatform`, `targetPlatform`, etc) has been removed in order to reduce confusion.  The predicate was was defined such that it matches only the 32-bit big-endian members of the POWER/PowerPC family, despite having a name which would imply a broader set of systems.  If you were using this predicate, you can replace `foo.isPowerPC` with `(with foo; isPower && is32bit && isBigEndian)`.
