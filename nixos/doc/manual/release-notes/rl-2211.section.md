# Release 22.11 (“Raccoon”, 2022.11/??) {#sec-release-22.11}

Support is planned until the end of June 2023, handing over to 23.05.

## Highlights {#sec-release-22.11-highlights}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

- During cross-compilation, tests are now executed if the test suite can be executed
  by the build platform. This is the case when doing “native” cross-compilation
  where the build and host platforms are largely the same, but the nixpkgs' cross
  compilation infrastructure is used, e.g. `pkgsStatic` and `pkgsLLVM`. Another
  possibility is that the build platform is a superset of the host platform, e.g. when
  cross-compiling from `x86_64-unknown-linux` to `i686-unknown-linux`.
  The predicate gating test suite execution is the newly added `canExecute`
  predicate: You can e.g. check if `stdenv.buildPlatform` can execute binaries
  built for `stdenv.hostPlatform` (i.e. produced by `stdenv.cc`) by evaluating
  `stdenv.buildPlatform.canExecute stdenv.hostPlatform`.

- PHP now defaults to PHP 8.1, updated from 8.0.

## New Services {#sec-release-22.11-new-services}

- [appvm](https://github.com/jollheef/appvm), Nix based app VMs. Available as [virtualisation.appvm](options.html#opt-virtualisation.appvm.enable).

- [dragonflydb](https://dragonflydb.io/), a modern replacement for Redis and Memcached. Available as [services.dragonflydb](#opt-services.dragonflydb.enable).

- [infnoise](https://github.com/leetronics/infnoise), a hardware True Random Number Generator dongle.
  Available as [services.infnoise](options.html#opt-services.infnoise.enable).
- [persistent-evdev](https://github.com/aiberia/persistent-evdev), a daemon to add virtual proxy devices that mirror a physical input device but persist even if the underlying hardware is hot-plugged. Available as [services.persistent-evdev](#opt-services.persistent-evdev.enable).

- [expressvpn](https://www.expressvpn.com), the CLI client for ExpressVPN. Available as [services.expressvpn](#opt-services.expressvpn.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-22.11-incompatibilities}

- The `isCompatible` predicate checking CPU compatibility is no longer exposed
  by the platform sets generated using `lib.systems.elaborate`. In most cases
  you will want to use the new `canExecute` predicate instead which also
  considers the kernel / syscall interface. It is briefly described in the
  release's [highlights section](#sec-release-22.11-highlights).
  `lib.systems.parse.isCompatible` still exists, but has changed semantically:
  Architectures with differing endianness modes are *no longer considered compatible*.

- The `isPowerPC` predicate, found on `platform` attrsets (`hostPlatform`, `buildPlatform`, `targetPlatform`, etc) has been removed in order to reduce confusion.  The predicate was was defined such that it matches only the 32-bit big-endian members of the POWER/PowerPC family, despite having a name which would imply a broader set of systems.  If you were using this predicate, you can replace `foo.isPowerPC` with `(with foo; isPower && is32bit && isBigEndian)`.

- PHP 7.4 is no longer supported due to upstream not supporting this
  version for the entire lifecycle of the 22.11 release.

- (Neo)Vim can not be configured with `configure.pathogen` anymore to reduce maintainance burden.
Use `configure.packages` instead.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-22.11-notable-changes}

- A new module was added for the Saleae Logic device family, providing the options `hardware.saleae-logic.enable` and `hardware.saleae-logic.package`.

- Matrix Synapse now requires entries in the `state_group_edges` table to be unique, in order to prevent accidentally introducing duplicate information (for example, because a database backup was restored multiple times). If your Synapse database already has duplicate rows in this table, this could fail with an error and require manual remediation.

- memtest86+ was updated from 5.00-coreboot-002 to 6.00-beta2. It is now the upstream version from https://www.memtest.org/, as coreboot's fork is no longer available.
