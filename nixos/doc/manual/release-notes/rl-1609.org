* Release 16.09 (“Flounder”, 2016/09/30)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-release-16.09
  :END:

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the
following highlights:

- Many NixOS configurations and Nix packages now use significantly less
  disk space, thanks to the
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/7117][extensive work on
  closure size reduction]]. For example, the closure size of a minimal
  NixOS container went down from ~424 MiB in 16.03 to ~212 MiB in 16.09,
  while the closure size of Firefox went from ~651 MiB to ~259 MiB.

- To improve security, packages are now
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/12895][built using various
  hardening features]]. See the Nixpkgs manual for more information.

- Support for PXE netboot. See [[#sec-booting-from-pxe][???]] for
  documentation.

- X.org server 1.18. If you use the =ati_unfree= driver, 1.17 is still
  used due to an ABI incompatibility.

- This release is based on Glibc 2.24, GCC 5.4.0 and systemd 231. The
  default Linux kernel remains 4.4.

The following new services were added since the last release:

- =(this will get automatically generated at release time)=

When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the following
incompatible changes:

- A large number of packages have been converted to use the multiple
  outputs feature of Nix to greatly reduce the amount of required disk
  space, as mentioned above. This may require changes to any custom
  packages to make them build again; see the relevant chapter in the
  Nixpkgs manual for more information. (Additional caveat to packagers:
  some packaging conventions related to multiple-output packages
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/14766][were changed]] late
  (August 2016) in the release cycle and differ from the initial
  introduction of multiple outputs.)

- Previous versions of Nixpkgs had support for all versions of the LTS
  Haskell package set. That support has been dropped. The previously
  provided =haskell.packages.lts-x_y= package sets still exist in name
  to aviod breaking user code, but these package sets don't actually
  contain the versions mandated by the corresponding LTS release.
  Instead, our package set it loosely based on the latest available LTS
  release, i.e. LTS 7.x at the time of this writing. New releases of
  NixOS and Nixpkgs will drop those old names entirely.
  [[https://nixos.org/nix-dev/2016-June/020585.html][The motivation for
  this change]] has been discussed at length on the =nix-dev= mailing
  list and in [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/14897][Github
  issue #14897]]. Development strategies for Haskell hackers who want to
  rely on Nix and NixOS have been described in
  [[https://nixos.org/nix-dev/2016-June/020642.html][another nix-dev
  article]].

- Shell aliases for systemd sub-commands
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/15598][were dropped]]:
  =start=, =stop=, =restart=, =status=.

- Redis now binds to 127.0.0.1 only instead of listening to all network
  interfaces. This is the default behavior of Redis 3.2

- =/var/empty= is now immutable. Activation script runs =chattr +i= to
  forbid any modifications inside the folder. See
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/18365][the pull request]] for
  what bugs this caused.

- Gitlab's maintainance script =gitlab-runner= was removed and split up
  into the more clearer =gitlab-run= and =gitlab-rake= scripts, because
  =gitlab-runner= is a component of Gitlab CI.

- =services.xserver.libinput.accelProfile= default changed from =flat=
  to =adaptive=, as per
  [[https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/group__config.html#gad63796972347f318b180e322e35cee79][official
  documentation]].

- =fonts.fontconfig.ultimate.rendering= was removed because our presets
  were obsolete for some time. New presets are hardcoded into FreeType;
  you can select a preset via =fonts.fontconfig.ultimate.preset=. You
  can customize those presets via ordinary environment variables, using
  =environment.variables=.

- The =audit= service is no longer enabled by default. Use
  =security.audit.enable = true= to explicitly enable it.

- =pkgs.linuxPackages.virtualbox= now contains only the kernel modules
  instead of the VirtualBox user space binaries. If you want to
  reference the user space binaries, you have to use the new
  =pkgs.virtualbox= instead.

- =goPackages= was replaced with separated Go applications in
  appropriate =nixpkgs= categories. Each Go package uses its own
  dependency set. There's also a new =go2nix= tool introduced to
  generate a Go package definition from its Go source automatically.

- =services.mongodb.extraConfig= configuration format was changed to
  YAML.

- PHP has been upgraded to 7.0

Other notable improvements:

- Revamped grsecurity/PaX support. There is now only a single
  general-purpose distribution kernel and the configuration interface
  has been streamlined. Desktop users should be able to simply set

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    security.grsecurity.enable = true
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  to get a reasonably secure system without having to sacrifice too much
  functionality.

- Special filesystems, like =/proc=, =/run= and others, now have the
  same mount options as recommended by systemd and are unified across
  different places in NixOS. Mount options are updated during
  =nixos-rebuild switch= if possible. One benefit from this is improved
  security --- most such filesystems are now mounted with =noexec=,
  =nodev= and/or =nosuid= options.

- The reverse path filter was interfering with DHCPv4 server operation
  in the past. An exception for DHCPv4 and a new option to log packets
  that were dropped due to the reverse path filter was added
  (=networking.firewall.logReversePathDrops=) for easier debugging.

- Containers configuration within =containers.<name>.config= is
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/17365][now properly typed and
  checked]]. In particular, partial configurations are merged correctly.

- The directory container setuid wrapper programs,
  =/var/setuid-wrappers=,
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/18124][is now updated
  atomically to prevent failures if the switch to a new configuration is
  interrupted.]]

- =services.xserver.startGnuPGAgent= has been removed due to GnuPG 2.1.x
  bump. See
  [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/5391882ebd781149e213e8817fba6ac3c503740c][how
  to achieve similar behavior]]. You might need to =pkill
      gpg-agent= after the upgrade to prevent a stale agent being in the
  way.

- [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/e561edc322d275c3687fec431935095cfc717147][Declarative
  users could share the uid due to the bug in the script handling
  conflict resolution.]]

- Gummi boot has been replaced using systemd-boot.

- Hydra package and NixOS module were added for convenience.
