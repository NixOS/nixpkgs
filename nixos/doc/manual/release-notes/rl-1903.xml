     The minimum version of Nix required to evaluate Nixpkgs is now 2.0.

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       For users of NixOS 18.03 and 19.03, NixOS defaults to Nix 2.0, but
       supports using Nix 1.11 by setting <literal>nix.package =
       pkgs.nix1;</literal>. If this option is set to a Nix 1.11 package, you
       will need to either unset the option or upgrade it to Nix 2.0.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       For users of NixOS 17.09, you will first need to upgrade Nix by setting
       <literal>nix.package = pkgs.nixStable2;</literal> and run
       <command>nixos-rebuild switch</command> as the <literal>root</literal>
       user.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       For users of a daemon-less Nix installation on Linux or macOS, you can
       upgrade Nix by running <command>curl https://nixos.org/nix/install |
       sh</command>, or prior to doing a channel update, running
       <command>nix-env -iA nix</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
       If you have already run a channel update and Nix is no longer able to
       evaluate Nixpkgs, the error message printed should provide adequate
       directions for upgrading Nix.

       For users of the Nix daemon on macOS, you can upgrade Nix by running

      The <literal>ntp</literal> module now has sane default restrictions.
      If you're relying on the previous defaults, which permitted all queries

     The <literal>light</literal> module no longer uses setuid binaries, but
     udev rules. As a consequence users of that module have to belong to the

     Buildbot now supports Python 3 and its packages have been moved to

     Network interface indiscriminate NixOS firewall options
     (<literal>networking.firewall.allow*</literal>) are now preserved when also

     These rules continue to use the pseudo device "default"
     (<literal>networking.firewall.interfaces.default.*</literal>), and assigning
     to this pseudo device will override the (<literal>networking.firewall.allow*</literal>)
     options.

   <para>
     The <literal>nscd</literal> service now disables all caching of
     <literal>passwd</literal> and <literal>group</literal> databases by
     default. This was interferring with the correct functioning of the
     <literal>libnss_systemd.so</literal> module which is used by
     <literal>systemd</literal> to manage uids and usernames in the presence of
     <literal>DynamicUser=</literal> in systemd services.  This was already the
     default behaviour in presence of <literal>services.sssd.enable =
       true</literal> because nscd caching would interfere with
     <literal>sssd</literal> in unpredictable ways as well.  Because we're
     using nscd not for caching, but for convincing glibc to find NSS modules
     in the nix store instead of an absolute path, we have decided to disable
     caching globally now, as it's usually not the behaviour the user wants and
     can lead to surprising behaviour.  Furthermore, negative caching of host
     lookups is also disabled now by default. This should fix the issue of dns
     lookups failing in the presence of an unreliable network.
   </para>
   <para>
     If the old behaviour is desired, this can be restored by setting
     the <literal>services.nscd.config</literal> option
     with the desired caching parameters.

     GitLab Shell previously used the nix store paths for the
     <literal>gitlab-shell</literal> command in its
     <literal>authorized_keys</literal> file, which might stop working after
     garbage collection. To circumvent that, we regenerated that file on each
     startup.  As <literal>gitlab-shell</literal> has now been changed to use
     <literal>/var/run/current-system/sw/bin/gitlab-shell</literal>, this is
     not necessary anymore, but there might be leftover lines with a nix store
     path. Regenerate the <literal>authorized_keys</literal> file via
     <command>sudo -u git -H gitlab-rake gitlab:shell:setup</command> in that
     case.

     The <literal>pam_unix</literal> account module is now loaded with its
     control field set to <literal>required</literal> instead of
     <literal>sufficient</literal>, so that later pam account modules that
     might do more extensive checks are being executed.
     Previously, the whole account module verification was exited prematurely
     in case a nss module provided the account name to
     <literal>pam_unix</literal>.
     The LDAP and SSSD NixOS modules already add their NSS modules when
     enabled. In case your setup breaks due to some later pam account module
     previosuly shadowed, or failing NSS lookups, please file a bug. You can
     get back the old behaviour by manually setting
     <literal><![CDATA[security.pam.services.<name?>.text]]></literal>.

      The Kubernetes DNS addons, kube-dns, has been replaced with CoreDNS.
      This change is made in accordance with Kubernetes making CoreDNS the official default

      <link xlink:href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md#sig-cluster-lifecycle">Kubernetes v1.11</link>.
      Please beware that upgrading DNS-addon on existing clusters might induce
      minor downtime while the DNS-addon terminates and re-initializes.
      Also note that the DNS-service now runs with 2 pod replicas by default.

       It is possible now to uze ZRAM devices as general purpose ephemeral block devices,

      Flat volumes are now disabled by default in <literal>hardware.pulseaudio</literal>.

     <para>
      With this change application specific volumes are relative to the master volume which can be
      adjusted independently, whereas before they were absolute; meaning that in effect, it scaled the
      device-volume with the volume of the loudest application.
