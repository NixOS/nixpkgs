      This is because of limitations with the screenlocking implementation,
      whereas the screenlocker would be non-functional without it.

     A major refactoring of the Kubernetes module has been completed.
     Refactorings primarily focus on decoupling components and enhancing
     security. Two-way TLS and RBAC has been enabled by default for all
     components, which slightly changes the way the module is configured. See:
     <xref linkend="sec-kubernetes"/> for details.

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       For users of NixOS 18.03 and 19.03, NixOS defaults to Nix 2.0, but
       supports using Nix 1.11 by setting <literal>nix.package =
       pkgs.nix1;</literal>. If this option is set to a Nix 1.11 package, you
       will need to either unset the option or upgrade it to Nix 2.0.

      <para>
       For users of NixOS 17.09, you will first need to upgrade Nix by setting

      <para>
       If you have already run a channel update and Nix is no longer able to

     continue to use the pseudo device "default"

    <para>
     The <literal>nscd</literal> service now disables all caching of
     <literal>passwd</literal> and <literal>group</literal> databases by
     default. This was interferring with the correct functioning of the
     <literal>libnss_systemd.so</literal> module which is used by
     <literal>systemd</literal> to manage uids and usernames in the presence of
     <literal>DynamicUser=</literal> in systemd services. This was already the
     default behaviour in presence of <literal>services.sssd.enable =
     true</literal> because nscd caching would interfere with
     <literal>sssd</literal> in unpredictable ways as well. Because we're using
     nscd not for caching, but for convincing glibc to find NSS modules in the
     nix store instead of an absolute path, we have decided to disable caching
     globally now, as it's usually not the behaviour the user wants and can
     lead to surprising behaviour. Furthermore, negative caching of host
     lookups is also disabled now by default. This should fix the issue of dns
     lookups failing in the presence of an unreliable network.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the old behaviour is desired, this can be restored by setting the
     <literal>services.nscd.config</literal> option with the desired caching
     parameters.

     GitLab Shell previously used the nix store paths for the
     <literal>gitlab-shell</literal> command in its
     <literal>authorized_keys</literal> file, which might stop working after
     garbage collection. To circumvent that, we regenerated that file on each
     startup. As <literal>gitlab-shell</literal> has now been changed to use
     <literal>/var/run/current-system/sw/bin/gitlab-shell</literal>, this is
     not necessary anymore, but there might be leftover lines with a nix store
     path. Regenerate the <literal>authorized_keys</literal> file via

     provided the account name to <literal>pam_unix</literal>. The LDAP and
     SSSD NixOS modules already add their NSS modules when enabled. In case
     your setup breaks due to some later PAM account module previosuly

     <literal>graylog</literal> has been upgraded from version 2.* to 3.*. Some
     setups making use of extraConfig (especially those exposing Graylog via
     reverse proxies) need to be updated as upstream removed/replaced some
     settings. See

     The <option>services.matomo</option> module gained the option
     <option>services.matomo.package</option> which determines the used Matomo
     version.
    </para>
    <para>
     The Matomo module now also comes with the systemd service
     <literal>matomo-archive-processing.service</literal> and a timer that
     automatically triggers archive processing every hour. This means that you
     can safely

     Privacy</literal>, but make sure that you run <literal>systemctl start
     matomo-archive-processing.service</literal> at least once without errors
     if you have already collected data before, so that the reports get
     archived before the source data gets deleted.

     The deprecated <literal>truecrypt</literal> package has been removed and
     <literal>truecrypt</literal> attribute is now an alias for
     <literal>veracrypt</literal>. VeraCrypt is backward-compatible with
     TrueCrypt volumes. Note that <literal>cryptsetup</literal> also supports
     loading TrueCrypt volumes.

     The Kubernetes DNS addons, kube-dns, has been replaced with CoreDNS. This
     change is made in accordance with Kubernetes making CoreDNS the official
     default starting from
     <link xlink:href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md#sig-cluster-lifecycle">Kubernetes
     v1.11</link>. Please beware that upgrading DNS-addon on existing clusters
     might induce minor downtime while the DNS-addon terminates and
     re-initializes. Also note that the DNS-service now runs with 2 pod
     replicas by default. The desired number of replicas can be configured
     using: <option>services.kubernetes.addons.dns.replicas</option>.

     It is possible now to uze ZRAM devices as general purpose ephemeral block
     devices, not only as swap. Using more than 1 device as ZRAM swap is no
     longer recommended, but is still possible by setting
     <literal>zramSwap.swapDevices</literal> explicitly.
    </para>
    <para>
     ZRAM algorithm can be changed now.
    </para>
    <para>
     Changes to ZRAM algorithm are applied during <literal>nixos-rebuild
     switch</literal>, so make sure you have enough swap space on disk to
     survive ZRAM device rebuild. Alternatively, use <literal>nixos-rebuild
     boot; reboot</literal>.

     Flat volumes are now disabled by default in
     <literal>hardware.pulseaudio</literal>. This has been done to prevent
     applications, which are unaware of this feature, setting their volumes to
     100% on startup causing harm to your audio hardware and potentially your
     ears.

     <para>
      With this change application specific volumes are relative to the master
      volume which can be adjusted independently, whereas before they were
      absolute; meaning that in effect, it scaled the device-volume with the
      volume of the loudest application.

     module now supports <link linkend="opt-services.ndppd.enable">all config
     options</link> provided by the current upstream version as service
     options. Additionally the <literal>ndppd</literal> package doesn't contain
     the systemd unit configuration from upstream anymore, the unit is

     The use of insecure ports on kubernetes has been deprecated. Thus options:
     <varname>services.kubernetes.apiserver.port</varname> and
     <varname>services.kubernetes.controllerManager.port</varname> has been
     renamed to <varname>.insecurePort</varname>, and default of both options
     has changed to 0 (disabled).

    <para>
     Note that the default value of
     <varname>services.kubernetes.apiserver.bindAddress</varname> has changed
     from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0, allowing the apiserver to be accessible from
     outside the master node itself. If the apiserver insecurePort is enabled,
     it is strongly recommended to only bind on the loopback interface. See:
     <varname>services.kubernetes.apiserver.insecurebindAddress</varname>.

     The <literal>intel</literal> driver has been removed from the default list
     of <link linkend="opt-services.xserver.videoDrivers">X.org video
     drivers</link>. The <literal>modesetting</literal> driver should take over
     automatically, it is better maintained upstream and has less problems with
     advanced X11 features. This can lead to a change in the output names used
     by <literal>xrandr</literal>. Some performance regressions on some GPU
     models might happen. Some OpenCL and VA-API applications might also break
     (Beignet seems to provide OpenCL support with
     <literal>modesetting</literal> driver, too). Kernel mode setting API does
     not support backlight control, so <literal>xbacklight</literal> tool will
     not work; backlight level can be controlled directly via
     <literal>/sys/</literal> or with <literal>brightnessctl</literal>. Users
     who need this functionality more than multi-output XRandR are advised to
     add `intel` to `videoDrivers` and report an issue (or provide additional
     details in an existing one)

     Openmpi has been updated to version 4.0.0, which removes some deprecated
     MPI-1 symbols. This may break some older applications that still rely on
     those symbols. An upgrade guide can be found
