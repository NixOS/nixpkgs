## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-26.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.kubernetes.addons.dns.coredns` has been renamed to `services.kubernetes.addons.dns.corednsImage` and now expects a
package instead of attrs. Now, by default, nixpkgs.coredns in conjunction with dockerTools.buildImage is used, instead
of pulling the upstream container image from Docker Hub. If you want the old behavior, you can set:

```nix
{
  services.kubernetes.addons.dns.corednsImage = pkgs.dockerTools.pullImage {
    imageName = "coredns/coredns";
    imageDigest = "sha256:af8c8d35a5d184b386c4a6d1a012c8b218d40d1376474c7d071bb6c07201f47d";
    finalImageTag = "v1.12.2";
    hash = "sha256-ZgXEyxVrdskQdgg0ONJ9sboAXEEHTgNsiptk5O945c0=";
  };
}
```

- Ethercalc and its associated module have been removed, as the package is unmaintained and cannot be installed from source with npm now.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-26.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.frp` now supports multiple instances through `services.frp.instances` to make it possible to run multiple frp clients or servers at the same time.

- `services.openssh` now supports generating host SSH keys by setting `services.openssh.generateHostKeys = true` while leaving `services.openssh.enable` disabled.  This is particularly useful for systems that have no need of an SSH daemon but want SSH host keys for other purposes such as using agenix or sops-nix.
