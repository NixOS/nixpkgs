## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-26.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.frp` now supports multiple instances through `services.frp.instances` to make it possible to run multiple frp clients or servers at the same time.

- `services.openssh` now supports generating host SSH keys by setting `services.openssh.generateHostKeys = true` while leaving `services.openssh.enable` disabled.  This is particularly useful for systems that have no need of an SSH daemon but want SSH host keys for other purposes such as using agenix or sops-nix.
