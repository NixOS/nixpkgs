## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-26.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.kubernetes.addons.dns.coredns` has been renamed to `services.kubernetes.addons.dns.corednsImage` and now expects a
package instead of attrs. Now, by default, nixpkgs.coredns in conjunction with dockerTools.buildImage is used, instead
of pulling the upstream container image from Docker Hub. If you want the old behavior, you can set:

```nix
{
  services.kubernetes.addons.dns.corednsImage = pkgs.dockerTools.pullImage {
    imageName = "coredns/coredns";
    imageDigest = "sha256:af8c8d35a5d184b386c4a6d1a012c8b218d40d1376474c7d071bb6c07201f47d";
    finalImageTag = "v1.12.2";
    hash = "sha256-ZgXEyxVrdskQdgg0ONJ9sboAXEEHTgNsiptk5O945c0=";
  };
}
```

- Ethercalc and its associated module have been removed, as the package is unmaintained and cannot be installed from source with npm now.

- The Bash implementation of the `nixos-rebuild` program is removed. All switchable systems now use the Python rewrite. Any prior usage of `system.rebuild.enableNg` must now be removed. If you have any outstanding issues with the new implementation, please open an issue on GitHub.

- `services.angrr` now uses TOML for configuration. Define policies with `services.angrr.settings` (generate TOML file) or point to a file using `services.angrr.configFile`. The legacy options `services.angrr.period`, `services.angrr.ownedOnly`, and `services.angrr.removeRoot` have been removed. See `man 5 angrr` and the description of `services.angrr.settings` options for examples and details.

- `services.pingvin-share` has been removed as the `pingvin-share.backend` package was broken and the project was archived upstream.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-26.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.frp` now supports multiple instances through `services.frp.instances` to make it possible to run multiple frp clients or servers at the same time.

- `services.openssh` now supports generating host SSH keys by setting `services.openssh.generateHostKeys = true` while leaving `services.openssh.enable` disabled.  This is particularly useful for systems that have no need of an SSH daemon but want SSH host keys for other purposes such as using agenix or sops-nix.
