      The user handling now keeps track of deallocated UIDs/GIDs. When a user
      or group is revived, this allows it to be allocated the UID/GID it had before.
      A consequence is that UIDs and GIDs are no longer reused.

      Modules can now be disabled by using <link
      xlink:href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#sec-replace-modules">
      disabledModules</link>, allowing another to take it's place.  This can be
      used to import a set of modules from another channel while keeping the
      rest of the system on a stable release.

      Updated to FreeType 2.7.1, including a new TrueType engine.
      The new engine replaces the Infinality engine which was the default in
      NixOS. The default font rendering settings are now provided by
      fontconfig-penultimate, replacing fontconfig-ultimate; the new defaults
      are less invasive and provide rendering that is more consistent with
      other systems and hopefully with each font designer's intent. Some
      system-wide configuration has been removed from the Fontconfig NixOS
      module where user Fontconfig settings are available.
