## Highlights {#sec-release-25.05-highlights}

- **This release of Nixpkgs requires macOS Big Sur 11.3 or newer, as announced in the 24.11 release notes.**
  We cannot guarantee that packages will continue to work on older versions of macOS.
  Future Nixpkgs releases will only support [macOS versions supported by Apple](https://endoflife.date/macos); this means that **Nixpkgs 25.11 will require macOS Sonoma 14 or newer**.
  Users on old macOS versions should consider upgrading to a supported version (potentially using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) for old hardware) or installing NixOS.
  If neither of those options are viable and you require new versions of software, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) supports versions back to Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.
