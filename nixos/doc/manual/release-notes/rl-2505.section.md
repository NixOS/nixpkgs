- **This release of Nixpkgs requires macOS Big Sur 11.3 or newer, as announced in the 24.11 release notes.**
  We cannot guarantee that packages will continue to work on older versions of macOS.
  Future Nixpkgs releases will only support [macOS versions supported by Apple](https://endoflife.date/macos); this means that **Nixpkgs 25.11 will require macOS Sonoma 14 or newer**.
  Users on old macOS versions should consider upgrading to a supported version (potentially using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) for old hardware) or installing NixOS.
  If neither of those options are viable and you require new versions of software, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) supports versions back to Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.

- GCC has been updated from GCC 13 to GCC 14.
  This introduces some backwards‐incompatible changes; see the [upstream porting guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html) for details.

- LLVM has been updated from LLVM 16 (on Darwin) and LLVM 18 (on other platforms) to LLVM 19.
  This introduces some backwards‐incompatible changes; see the [upstream release notes](https://releases.llvm.org/) for details.

- `buildGoPackage` has been removed. Use `buildGoModule` instead. See the [Go section in the nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-language-go) for details.

- `timescaledb` requires manual upgrade steps.
    After you run ALTER EXTENSION, you must run [this SQL script](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-extras/blob/master/utils/2.15.X-fix_hypertable_foreign_keys.sql). For more details, see the following pull requests [#6797](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/pull/6797).
    PostgreSQL 13 is no longer supported in TimescaleDB v2.16.

- `kanata` was updated to v1.7.0, which introduces several breaking changes.
  See the release notes of
  [v1.7.0](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
  for more information.

- the notmuch vim plugin now lives in a separate output of the `notmuch`
  package. Installing `notmuch` will not bring the notmuch vim package anymore,
  add `vimPlugins.notmuch-vim` to your (Neo)vim configuration if you want the
  vim plugin.
