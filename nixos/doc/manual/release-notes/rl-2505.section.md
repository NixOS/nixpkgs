# Nixos 25.05 (“Warbler”, 2025.05/??) {#sec-release-25.05}

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.05-highlights}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Initial support for the [COSMIC DE](https://system76.com/cosmic), a Rust-based desktop environment by System76, makers of Pop!_OS. Toggle the greeter (login manager) using `services.displayManager.cosmic-greeter.enable` and the DE itself with `services.desktopManager.cosmic.enable`. Mostly stable but still experimental. Please report any issues to the [COSMIC DE tracker in Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/259641) instead of upstream.

- `services.dex` now restarts upon changes to the `.environmentFile` or entries in `.settings.staticClients[].secretFile` when the entry is a `path` type.

- `nixos-rebuild-ng`, a full rewrite of `nixos-rebuild` in Python, is available for testing. You can enable it by setting [system.rebuild.enableNg](options.html#opt-system.rebuild.enableNg) in your configuration (this will replace the old `nixos-rebuild`), or by adding `nixos-rebuild-ng` to your `environment.systemPackages` (in this case, it will live side-by-side with `nixos-rebuild` as `nixos-rebuild-ng`). It is expected that the next major version of NixOS (25.11) will enable `system.rebuild.enableNg` by default.

- The `nixos-generate-config` command now supports a optional `--flake` option, which will generate a flake.nix file alongside the `configuration.nix` and `hardware-configuration.nix`, providing an easy instroduction into flake-based system configurations.

- A `nixos-rebuild build-image` sub-command has been added.
  It allows users to build platform-specific (disk) images from their NixOS configurations. `nixos-rebuild build-image` works similar to the popular [nix-community/nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) project. See new [section on image building in the NixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-image-nixos-rebuild-build-image). It is also available for `nixos-rebuild-ng`.

- `nixos-option` has been rewritten to a Nix expression called by a simple bash script. This lowers our maintenance threshold, makes eval errors less verbose, adds support for flake-based configurations, descending into `attrsOf` and `listOf` submodule options, and `--show-trace`.

- The `intel` video driver for X.org (from the xf86-video-intel package) which was previously removed because it was non-functional has been fixed and the driver has been re-introduced.

- The Mattermost module ({option}`services.mattermost`) and packages (`mattermost` and `mmctl`) have been substantially updated:
  - {option}`services.mattermost.preferNixConfig` now defaults to true if you advance {option}`system.stateVersion` to 25.05. This means that if you have {option}`services.mattermost.mutableConfig` set, NixOS will override your settings to those that you define in the module. It is recommended to leave this at the default, even if you used a mutable config before, because it will ensure that your Mattermost data directories are correct. If you moved your data directories, you may want to review the module changes before upgrading.
  - Mattermost telemetry reporting is now disabled by default, though security update notifications are enabled. Look at {option}`services.mattermost.telemetry` for options to control this behavior.
  - `pkgs.mattermostLatest` is now an option to track the latest (non-prerelease) Mattermost release. We test upgrade migrations from ESR releases (`pkgs.mattermost`) to `pkgs.mattermostLatest`.
  - The Mattermost frontend is now built from source and can be overridden.
    - Note that the Mattermost derivation containing both the webapp and server is now wrapped to allow them to be built independently, so overrides to both webapp and server look like `mattermost.overrideAttrs (prev: { webapp = prev.webapp.override { ... }; server = prev.server.override { ... }; })` now.
  - `services.mattermost.listenAddress` has been split into {option}`services.mattermost.host` and {option}`services.mattermost.port`. If your `listenAddress` contained a port, you will need to edit your configuration.
  - Mattermost now supports peer authentication on both MySQL and Postgres database backends. Updating {option}`system.stateVersion` to 25.05 or later will result in peer authentication being used by default if the Mattermost server would otherwise be connecting to localhost. This is the recommended configuration.
  - The Mattermost module will produce eval warnings if a database password would end up in the Nix store, and recommend alternatives such as peer authentication or using the environment file.
  - Mattermost's entire test suite is now enabled by default, which will extend build time from sources by up to an hour. A `withoutTests` passthru has been added in case you want to skip it.
  - We now support `mmctl` for Mattermost administration if both {option}`services.mattermost.socket.enable` and {option}`services.mattermost.socket.export` are set, which export the Mattermost control socket path into the system environment.
  - A new `pkgs.mattermost.buildPlugin` function has been added, which allows plugins to be built from source, including webapp frontends with a supported package-lock.json. See the Mattermost NixOS test and [manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-mattermost-plugins-build) for an example.
  - Note that the Mattermost module will create an account _without_ a well-known UID if the username differs from the default (`mattermost`). If you used Mattermost with a nonstandard username, you may want to review the module changes before upgrading.

- androidenv has been updated:
  - All versions specified in composeAndroidPackages now track latest. Android packages are automatically updated on unstable, and run the androidenv test suite on every update.
  - Some androidenv packages are now searchable on [search.nixos.org](https://search.nixos.org).
  - We now use the latest Google repositories, which should improve aarch64-darwin compatibility. The SDK now additionally evaluates on aarch64-linux, though not all packages are functional.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-25.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.rippled` has been removed, as `rippled` was broken and had not been updated since 2022.

- `services.rippleDataApi` has been removed, as `ripple-data-api` was broken and had not been updated since 2022.

- The `nixos/modules/virtualisation/amazon-ec2-amis.nix` file is not supported anymore since 24.05. It will throw
  and error starting 25.05 with instructions the following instructions:
  The canonical source for NixOS AMIs is the AWS API. Please see https://nixos.org/download/#nixos-amazon or  https://nixos.github.io/amis/ for instructions.

- The udev rules of the libjaylink package require users to be in the `jlink` instead of `plugdev` group now, since the `plugdev` group is very uncommon for NixOS. Alternatively, access is granted to seat sessions.

- The latest available version of Nextcloud is v31 (available as `pkgs.nextcloud31`). The installation logic is as follows:
  - If [`services.nextcloud.package`](#opt-services.nextcloud.package) is specified explicitly, this package will be installed (**recommended**)
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=24.11, `pkgs.nextcloud30` will be installed by default.
  - If [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is >=24.05, `pkgs.nextcloud31` will be installed by default.
  - Please note that an upgrade from v29 (or older) to v31 directly is not possible. Please upgrade to `nextcloud30` (or earlier) first. Nextcloud prohibits skipping major versions while upgrading. You can upgrade by declaring [`services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud30;`](options.html#opt-services.nextcloud.package).

- `services.cloudflare-dyndns.apiTokenFile` now must be just your Cloudflare api token. Previously it was supposed to be a file of the form `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...`.

- [](#opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbtype) is unset by default, the previous default was `sqlite`.
  This was done because `sqlite` is not a reasonable default since it's
  [not recommended by upstream](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/30/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html)
  and thus doesn't qualify as default.

- Nextcloud's default FPM pool settings have been increased according to upstream recommentations. It's advised
  to review the new defaults and description of
  [](#opt-services.nextcloud.poolSettings).

- The `services.locate` module does no longer support findutil's `locate` due to its inferior performance compared to `mlocate` and `plocate`. The new default is `plocate`.
  As the `service.locate.localuser` option only applied when using findutil's `locate`, it has also been removed.

- `services.paperless` now installs `paperless-manage` as a normal system package instead of creating a symlink in `/var/lib/paperless`.
  `paperless-manage` now also changes to the appropriate user when being executed.

- `asusd` has been upgraded to version 6 which supports multiple aura devices. To account for this, the single `auraConfig` configuration option has been replaced with `auraConfigs` which is an attribute set of config options per each device. The config files may also be now specified as either source files or text strings; to account for this you will need to specify that `text` is used for your existing configs, e.g.:
  ```diff
  -services.asusd.asusdConfig = '''file contents'''
  +services.asusd.asusdConfig.text = '''file contents'''
  ```

- `linuxPackages.nvidiaPackages.stable` now defaults to the `production` variant instead of `latest`.

- `timescaledb` requires manual upgrade steps.
    After you run ALTER EXTENSION, you must run [this SQL script](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-extras/blob/master/utils/2.15.X-fix_hypertable_foreign_keys.sql). For more details, see the following pull requests [#6797](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/pull/6797).
    PostgreSQL 13 is no longer supported in TimescaleDB v2.16.

- `virtualisation/azure-common.nix`'s filesystem and grub configurations have been moved to `virtualisation/azure-image.nix`. This makes `azure-common.nix` more generic so it could be used for users who generate Azure image using other methods (e.g. nixos-generators and disko). For existing users depending on these configurations, please also import `azure-image.nix`.

- `zammad` has had its support for MySQL removed, since it was never working correctly and is now deprecated upstream. Check the [migration guide](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/appendix/migrate-to-postgresql.html) for how to convert your database to PostgreSQL.

- `tauon` 7.9.0+ when launched for the first time, migrates its database to a new schema that is not backwards compatible. Older versions will refuse to start at all with that database afterwards. If you need to still use older tauon versions, make sure to back up `~/.local/share/TauonMusicBox`.

- The `earlyoom` service is now using upstream systemd service, which enables
  hardening and filesystem isolation by default. If you need filesystem write
  access or want to access home directory via `killHook`, hardening setting can
  be changed via, e.g. `systemd.services.earlyoom.serviceConfig.ProtectSystem`.

  `services.earlyoom.extraArgs` is now shell-escaped for each element without
  word-breaking. So you want to write `extraArgs = [ "--prefer" "spaced pat" ]`
  rather than previous `extraArgs = [ "--prefer 'spaced pat'" ]`.

- `programs.less.lessopen` is now null by default. To restore the previous behaviour, set it to `''|${lib.getExe' pkgs.lesspipe "lesspipe.sh"} %s''`.

- `hardware.pulseaudio` has been renamed to `services.pulseaudio`.  The deprecated option names will continue to work, but causes a warning.

- `services.nextcloud` now uses systemd's credential mechanism to read in secret files. The `nextcloud-occ` wrapper script implements this using `systemd-run`, as such it now also requires root privileges or `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` set where running it as user `nextcloud` was enough previously.

- `services.mongodb.initialRootPassword` has been replaced with the more secure option [`services.mongodb.initialRootPasswordFile`](#opt-services.mongodb.initialRootPasswordFile)

- `services.bird2` has been renamed to `services.bird` and the default bird package has been switched to `bird3`. `bird2` can still be chosen via the `services.bird.package` option.

- DokuWiki with the Caddy webserver (`services.dokuwiki.webserver = "caddy"`) now sets up sites with Caddy's automatic HTTPS instead of HTTP-only.
  To keep the old behavior for a site `example.com`, set `services.caddy.virtualHosts."example.com".hostName = "http://example.com"`.
  If you set custom Caddy options for a DokuWiki site, migrate these options by removing `http://` from `services.caddy.virtualHosts."http://example.com"`.

- Wordpress with the Caddy webserver (`services.wordpress.webserver = "caddy"`) now sets up sites with Caddy's automatic HTTPS instead of HTTP-only.
  Given a site example.com, http://example.com now 301 redirects to https://example.com.
  To keep the old behavior for a site `example.com`, set `services.caddy.virtualHosts."example.com".hostName = "http://example.com"`.

- The behavior of `services.hostapd.radios.<name>.networks.<name>.authentication.enableRecommendedPairwiseCiphers` was changed to not include `CCMP-256` anymore.
  Since all configured pairwise ciphers have to be supported by the radio, this caused startup failures on many devices which is hard to debug in hostapd.

- `gkraken` software and `hardware.gkraken.enable` option have been removed, use `coolercontrol` via `programs.coolercontrol.enable` option instead.

- To avoid delaying user logins unnecessarily the `multi-user.target` is no longer ordered after `network-online.target`.
  System services requiring a connection to start correctly must explicitly state so, i.e.
  ```nix
  systemd.services.<name> = {
    wants = [ "network-online.target" ];
    after = [ "network-online.target" ];
  };
  ```
  This changed follows a deprecation period of one year started in NixOS 24.05 (see [PR #283818](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/283818)).

- The values of `services.borgbackup.jobs.*.extraArgs` and other `extra*Args` options are now represented as Bash arrays. If these arguments were modified using `services.borgbackup.jobs.*.preHook`, they will need to be adjusted to append to these arrays, i.e.
  ```diff
  -extraCreateArgs="$extraCreateArgs --exclude /some/path"
  +extraCreateArgs+=("--exclude" "/some/path")
  ```

- `programs.xonsh.package` now gets overrided internally with `extraPackages` to support `programs.xonsh.extraPackages`. See `programs.xonsh.extraPackages` for more details.

- `services.nitter.guestAccounts` has been renamed to `services.nitter.sessionsFile`, for consistency with upstream. The file format is unchanged.

- `virtualisation.azure.agent` option provided by `azure-agent.nix` is replaced by `services.waagent`, and will be removed in a future release.

- The ZFS import service now respects `fileSystems.*.options = [ "noauto" ];` and does not add that pool's import service to `zfs-import.target`, meaning it will not be automatically imported at boot.

- Default file names of images generated by several builders in `system.build` have been changed as outlined in the table below.

  Names are now known at evaluation time and customizable via the new options `image.baseName`, `image.extension`, `image.fileName` and `image.filePath` with the latter returning a path relative to the derivations out path (e.g. `iso/${image.fileName` for iso images).

  | `system.build` Option    | Old Filename                                               | New Filename                                                    |

- `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.enforce` and `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.enable` were removed.
  Configuring the state of apparmor policies must now be done using `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.state` tristate option.
- `services.graylog.package` now defaults to `graylog-6_0` as previous default `graylog-5_1` is EOL and therefore removed.
  Check the migration guides on [5.1→5.2](https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-2/upgrading_graylog/upgrading_to_graylog_5.2.x.htm) and [5.2→6.0](https://go2docs.graylog.org/6-0/upgrading_graylog/upgrading_to_graylog_6.0.x.html) for breaking changes.


- `programs.clash-verge.tunMode` was deprecated and removed because now service mode is necessary to start program. Without `programs.clash-verge.enable`, clash-verge-rev will refuse to start.

- `services.netbird.tunnels` was renamed to [`services.netbird.clients`](#opt-services.netbird.clients),
  hardened (using dedicated less-privileged users) and significantly extended.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-25.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `virtualisation.containers` with backend "podman" now supports rootless containers and `sd_notify(3)`-integration
  based on container healthchecks.

- Cinnamon has been updated to 6.4, please check the [upstream announcement](https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_xia_whatsnew.php) for more details.
  - Following [changes in Mint 22](https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupgrade/commit/f239cde908288b8c250f938e7311c7ffbc16bd59) we are no longer overriding Qt application styles. You can still restore the previous default with `qt.style = "gtk2"` and `qt.platformTheme = "gtk2"`.
  - Following [changes in Mint 20](https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupgrade-legacy/commit/ce15d946ed9a8cb8444abd25088edd824bfb18f6) we are replacing xplayer with celluloid since xplayer is no longer maintained.

- Pantheon has been updated to 8, please check the [upstream announcement](https://blog.elementary.io/os-8-available-now/) for more details.
  - Same as elementary OS, the X11 session is named "Classic Session" and the Wayland session is named "Secure Session".
  - The dock has been rewritten, you need to manually migrate the dock items on update. You can check `~/.config/plank/dock1/launchers/` for your previous settings.

- Xfce has been updated to 4.20, please check the [upstream feature tour](https://www.xfce.org/about/tour420) for more details.
  - Wayland session is still [experimental](https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/wayland_roadmap) and requires opt-in using `enableWaylandSession` option.
  - Overriding Wayland compositor is possible using `waylandSessionCompositor` option, but you might need to take care [`xfce4-session`](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/-/merge_requests/49), [`dbus-update-activation-environment`](https://github.com/labwc/labwc/blob/eaf11face68ee1f1bcc7ce1498304ca8c108c8ba/src/config/session.c#L234) and [`systemctl --user import-environment`](https://github.com/labwc/labwc/blob/eaf11face68ee1f1bcc7ce1498304ca8c108c8ba/src/config/session.c#L239) on startup.
  - For new Xfce installations, default panel layout has [changed](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/-/merge_requests/158/diffs) to not include external panel plugins by default. You can still add them yourself using the "Panel Preferences" dialog.

- [`system.stateVersion`](#opt-system.stateVersion) is now validated and must be in the `"YY.MM"` format, ideally corresponding to a prior NixOS release.


- [`services.geoclue2`](#opt-services.geoclue2.enable) now has an `enableStatic` option, which allows the NixOS configuration to specify a fixed location for GeoClue to use.

- [`services.mongodb`](#opt-services.mongodb.enable) is now compatible with the `mongodb-ce` binary package. To make use of it, set [`services.mongodb.package`](#opt-services.mongodb.package) to `pkgs.mongodb-ce`.

- [`services.jupyter`](#opt-services.jupyter.enable) is now compatible with `Jupyter Notebook 7`. See [the migration guide](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrate_to_notebook7.html) for details.

- `networking.wireguard` now has an optional networkd backend. It is enabled by default when `networking.useNetworkd` is enabled, and it can be enabled alongside scripted networking with `networking.wireguard.useNetworkd`. Some `networking.wireguard` options have slightly different behavior with the networkd and script-based backends, documented in each option.

- The `stackclashprotection` hardening flag has been enabled by default on compilers that support it.

- `services.rss-bridge` now has a `package` option as well as support for `caddy` as reverse proxy.

- `services.avahi.ipv6` now defaults to true.

- In the `services.xserver.displayManager.startx` module, two new options [generateScript](#opt-services.xserver.displayManager.startx.generateScript) and [extraCommands](#opt-services.xserver.displayManager.startx.extraCommands) have been added to to declaratively configure the .xinitrc script.

- All services that require a root certificate bundle now use the value of a new read-only option, `security.pki.caBundle`.

- hddfancontrol has been updated to major release 2. See the [migration guide](https://github.com/desbma/hddfancontrol/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#migrating-from-v1x), as there are breaking changes.

- `nextcloud-news-updater` is unmaintained and was removed from nixpkgs.

- `services.cloudflared` now uses a dynamic user, and its `user` and `group` options have been removed. If the user or group is still necessary, they can be created manually.

- The Home Assistant module has new options {option}`services.home-assistant.blueprints.automation`, `services.home-assistant.blueprints.script`, and {option}`services.home-assistant.blueprints.template` that allow for the declarative installation of [blueprints](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/) into the appropriate configuration directories.

- `services.dovecot2.modules` have been removed, now need to use `environment.systemPackages` to load additional Dovecot modules.

- `services.kmonad` now creates a determinate symlink (in `/dev/input/by-id/`) to each of KMonad virtual devices.

- `services.searx` now supports configuration of the favicons cache and other options available in SearXNG's `favicons.toml` file

- `services.gitea` now supports CAPTCHA usage through the `services.gitea.captcha` variable.

- `services.soft-serve` now restarts upon config change.

- `services.keycloak` now provides a `realmFiles` option that allows to import realms during startup. See https://www.keycloak.org/server/importExport

- `bind.cacheNetworks` now only controls access for recursive queries, where it previously controlled access for all queries.

- [`services.mongodb.enableAuth`](#opt-services.mongodb.enableAuth) now uses the newer [mongosh](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongosh) shell instead of the legacy shell to configure the initial superuser. You can configure the mongosh package to use through the [`services.mongodb.mongoshPackage`](#opt-services.mongodb.mongoshPackage) option.

- The paperless module now has an option for regular automatic export of
  documents data using the integrated document exporter.

- New options for the declarative configuration of the user space part of ALSA have been introduced under [hardware.alsa](options.html#opt-hardware.alsa.enable), including setting the default capture and playback device, defining sound card aliases and volume controls.
  Note: these are intended for users not running a sound server like PulseAudio or PipeWire, but having ALSA as their only sound system.

- `services.k3s` now provides the `autoDeployCharts` option that allows to automatically deploy Helm charts via the k3s Helm controller.

- Caddy can now be built with plugins by using `caddy.withPlugins`, a `passthru` function that accepts an attribute set as a parameter. The `plugins` argument represents a list of Caddy plugins, with each Caddy plugin being a versioned module. The `hash` argument represents the `vendorHash` of the resulting Caddy source code with the plugins added.

  Example:
  ```nix
  services.caddy = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.caddy.withPlugins {
      plugins = [
        # tagged upstream
        "github.com/caddy-dns/powerdns@v1.0.1"
        # pseudo-version number generated by Go
        "github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare@v0.0.0-20240703190432-89f16b99c18e"
        "github.com/mholt/caddy-webdav@v0.0.0-20241008162340-42168ba04c9d"
      ];
      hash = "sha256-wqXSd1Ep9TVpQi570TTb96LwzNYvWL5EBJXMJfYWCAk=";
    };
  };
  ```

  To get the necessary hash of the vendored dependencies, omit `hash`. The build will fail and tell you the correct value.

  Note that all provided plugins must have versions/tags (string after `@`), even if upstream repo does not tag each release. For untagged plugins, you can either create an empty Go project and run `go get <plugin>` and see changes in `go.mod` to get the pseudo-version number, or provide a commit hash in place of version/tag for the first run, and update the plugin string based on the error output.

- KDE Partition Manager `partitionmanager`'s support for ReiserFS is removed.
  ReiserFS has not been actively maintained for many years. It has been marked as obsolete since Linux 6.6, and
  [is removed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c01f664e4ca210823b7594b50669bbd9b0a3c3b0)
  in Linux 6.13.

- `authelia` version 4.39.0 has made some changes which deprecate older configurations.
  They are still expected to be working until future version 5.0.0, but will generate warnings in logs.
  Read the [release notes](https://www.authelia.com/blog/4.39-release-notes/) for human readable summaries of the changes.

- `programs.fzf.keybindings` now supports the fish shell.

- A toggle has been added under `users.users.<name>.enable` to allow toggling individual users conditionally. If set to false, the user account will not be created.
