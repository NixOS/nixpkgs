# Release 25.05 (“Warbler”, 2025.05/??) {#sec-release-25.05}

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.05-highlights}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The default PHP version has been updated to 8.3.

- `nixos-rebuild-ng`, a full rewrite of `nixos-rebuild` in Python, is available for testing. You can enable it by setting [system.rebuild.enableNg](options.html#opt-system.rebuild.enableNg) in your configuration (this will replace the old `nixos-rebuild`), or by adding `nixos-rebuild-ng` to your `environment.systemPackages` (in this case, it will live side-by-side with `nixos-rebuild` as `nixos-rebuild-ng`). It is expected that the next major version of NixOS (25.11) will enable `system.rebuild.enableNg` by default.

- A `nixos-rebuild build-image` sub-command has been added.

  It allows users to build platform-specific (disk) images from their NixOS configurations. `nixos-rebuild build-image` works similar to the popular [nix-community/nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) project. See new [section on image building in the nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-image-nixos-rebuild-build-image).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-25.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `binwalk` was updated to 3.1.0, which has been rewritten in rust. The python module is no longer available.
  See the release notes of [3.1.0](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/releases/tag/v3.1.0) for more information.

- `buildGoModule` now passes environment variables via the `env` attribute. `CGO_ENABLED` should now be specified with `env.CGO_ENABLED` when passing to buildGoModule. Direct specification of `CGO_ENABLED` is now redirected by a compatibility layer with a warning, but will become an error in future releases.

  Go-related environment variables previously shadowed by `buildGoModule` now results in errors when specified directly. Such variables include `GOOS` and `GOARCH`.

  Third-party projects supporting both stable and unstable channels could detect this change through the absence of the `CGO_ENABLED` function argument in `buildGoModule` (`!((lib.functionArgs buildGoModule) ? CGO_ENABLED)`).

- `buildGoPackage` has been removed. Use `buildGoModule` instead. See the [Go section in the nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-language-go) for details.

- `strawberry` has been updated to 1.2, which drops support for the VLC backend and Qt 5. The `strawberry-qt5` package
  and `withGstreamer`/`withVlc` override options have been removed due to this.

- `ps3-disc-dumper` was updated to 4.2.5, which removed the CLI project and now exclusively offers the GUI

- `timescaledb` requires manual upgrade steps.
    After you run ALTER EXTENSION, you must run [this SQL script](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-extras/blob/master/utils/2.15.X-fix_hypertable_foreign_keys.sql). For more details, see the following pull requests [#6797](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/pull/6797).
    PostgreSQL 13 is no longer supported in TimescaleDB v2.16.

- Support for CUDA 10 has been dropped, as announced in the 24.11 release notes.

- `zammad` has had its support for MySQL removed, since it was never working correctly and is now deprecated upstream. Check the [migration guide](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/appendix/migrate-to-postgresql.html) for how to convert your database to PostgreSQL.

- `nodePackages.vls` has been deprecated, as the upstream consumer of it, vetur, has been deprecated by upstream. Upstream suggests migrating to Volar for Vue LSP tooling instead.

- `nodePackages.create-react-native-app` has been removed, as it is deprecated. Upstream suggests using a framework for React Native apps instead.

- `nodePackages.insect` has been removed, as it's deprecated by upstream. The suggested replacement is `numbat`.

- `nodePackages.webpack-dev-server` has been removed, as it should be installed in projects that use it instead.

- `nodePackages.copy-webpack-plugin` has been removed, as it should be installed in projects that use it instead.

- `linuxPackages.nvidiaPackages.dc_520` has been removed since it is marked broken and there are better newer alternatives.

- `racket_7_9` has been removed, as it is insecure. It is recommended to use Racket 8 instead.

- `ente-auth` now uses the name `enteauth` for its binary. The previous name was `ente_auth`.

- `fluxus` has been removed, as it depends on `racket_7_9` and had no updates in 9 years.

- `renovate` was updated to v39. See the [upstream release notes](https://docs.renovatebot.com/release-notes-for-major-versions/#version-39) for breaking changes.
  Like upstream's docker images, renovate now runs on NodeJS 22.

- The behavior of the `networking.nat.externalIP` and `networking.nat.externalIPv6` options has been changed. `networking.nat.forwardPorts` now only forwards packets destined for the specified IP addresses.

- `python3Packages.jaeger-client` was removed because it was deprecated upstream. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is the recommended replacement.

- `nodePackages.meshcommander` has been removed, as the package was deprecated by Intel.

- `kanata` was updated to v1.7.0, which introduces several breaking changes.
  See the release notes of
  [v1.7.0](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
  for more information.

- `nodePackages.expo-cli` has been removed, as it was deprecated by upstream. The suggested replacement is the `npx expo` command.

- DokuWiki with the Caddy webserver (`services.dokuwiki.webserver = "caddy"`) now sets up sites with Caddy's automatic HTTPS instead of HTTP-only.
  To keep the old behavior for a site `example.com`, set `services.caddy.virtualHosts."example.com".hostName = "http://example.com"`.
  If you set custom Caddy options for a DokuWiki site, migrate these options by removing `http://` from `services.caddy.virtualHosts."http://example.com"`.

- `vscode-utils.buildVscodeExtension` now requires pname as an argument

- `nerdfonts` has been separated into individual font packages under the namespace `nerd-fonts`. The directories for font
  files have changed from `$out/share/fonts/{opentype,truetype}/NerdFonts` to
  `$out/share/fonts/{opentype,truetype}/NerdFonts/<fontDirName>`, where `<fontDirName>` can be found in the
  [official website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) as the titles in preview images, with the "Nerd Font"
  suffix and any whitespaces trimmed. Configuration changes are required, see build output.

- `retroarch` has been refactored and the older `retroarch.override { cores = [ ... ]; }` to create a RetroArch derivation with custom cores doesn't work anymore, use `retroarch.withCores (cores: [ ... ])` instead. If you need more customization (e.g.: custom settings), use `wrapRetroArch` instead.

- `gkraken` software and `hardware.gkraken.enable` option have been removed, use `coolercontrol` via `programs.coolercontrol.enable` option instead.

- To avoid delaying user logins unnecessarily the `multi-user.target` is no longer ordered after `network-online.target`.
  System services requiring a connection to start correctly must explicitly state so, i.e.
  ```nix
  systemd.services.<name> = {
    wants = [ "network-online.target" ];
    after = [ "network-online.target" ];
  };
  ```
  This changed follows a deprecation period of one year started in NixOS 24.05 (see [PR #283818](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/283818)).

- `nodePackages.ganache` has been removed, as the package has been deprecated by upstream.

- `virtualisation.azure.agent` option provided by `azure-agent.nix` is replaced by `services.waagent`, and will be removed in a future release.

- `matomo` now defaults to version 5 (previously available as `matomo_5`). Version 4 has been removed as it reached EOL on December 19, 2024.

- `containerd` has been updated to v2, which contains breaking changes. See the [containerd
  2.0](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/containerd-2.0.md) documentation for more
  details.

- The ZFS import service now respects `fileSystems.*.options = [ "noauto" ];` and does not add that pool's import service to `zfs-import.target`, meaning it will not be automatically imported at boot.

- `nodePackages.stackdriver-statsd-backend` has been removed, as the StackDriver service has been discontinued by Google, and therefore the package no longer works.

- `python3Packages.opentracing` has been removed due to being unmaintained upstream. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is the recommended replacement.

- Default file names of images generated by several builders in `system.build` have been changed as outlined in the table below.

  Names are now known at evaluation time and customizable via the new options `image.baseName`, `image.extension`, `image.fileName` and `image.filePath` with the latter returning a path relative to the derivations out path (e.g. `iso/${image.fileName` for iso images).

- `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.enforce` and `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.enable` were removed.
  Configuring the state of apparmor policies must now be done using `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.state` tristate option.

- the notmuch vim plugin now lives in a separate output of the `notmuch`
  package. Installing `notmuch` will not bring the notmuch vim package anymore,
  add `vimPlugins.notmuch-vim` to your (Neo)vim configuration if you want the
  vim plugin.

- `prisma` and `prisma-engines` have been updated to version 6.0.1, which
  introduces several breaking changes. See the
  [Prisma ORM upgrade guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-6)
  for more information.

- `zf` was updated to 0.10.2, which includes breaking changes from the [0.10.0 release](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf/releases/tag/0.10.0).
  `zf` no longer does Unicode normalization of the input and no longer supports terminal escape sequences in the `ZF_PROMPT` environment variable.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-25.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Cinnamon has been updated to 6.4, please check the [upstream announcement](https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_xia_whatsnew.php) for more details.
  - Following [changes in Mint 22](https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupgrade/commit/f239cde908288b8c250f938e7311c7ffbc16bd59) we are no longer overriding Qt application styles. You can still restore the previous default with `qt.style = "gtk2"` and `qt.platformTheme = "gtk2"`.

- Xfce has been updated to 4.20, please check the [upstream feature tour](https://www.xfce.org/about/tour420) for more details.
  - Wayland session is still [experimental](https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/wayland_roadmap) and requires opt-in using `enableWaylandSession` option.
  - Overriding Wayland compositor is possible using `enableWaylandSession` option, but you might need to take care [`xfce4-session`](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/-/merge_requests/49), [`dbus-update-activation-environment`](https://github.com/labwc/labwc/blob/eaf11face68ee1f1bcc7ce1498304ca8c108c8ba/src/config/session.c#L234) and [`systemctl --user import-environment`](https://github.com/labwc/labwc/blob/eaf11face68ee1f1bcc7ce1498304ca8c108c8ba/src/config/session.c#L239) on startup.
  - For new Xfce installations, default panel layout has [changed](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/-/merge_requests/158/diffs) to not include external panel plugins by default. You can still add them yourself using the "Panel Preferences" dialog.

- `networking.wireguard` now has an optional networkd backend. It is enabled by default when `networking.useNetworkd` is enabled, and it can be enabled alongside scripted networking with `networking.wireguard.useNetworkd`. Some `networking.wireguard` options have slightly different behavior with the networkd and script-based backends, documented in each option.

- `services.avahi.ipv6` now defaults to true.

- `bind.cacheNetworks` now only controls access for recursive queries, where it previously controlled access for all queries.

- `programs.fzf.keybindings` now supports the fish shell.

## Nixpkgs Library {#sec-release-25.05-lib}

### Breaking changes {#sec-release-25.05-lib-breaking}

- Structure of the `functor` of some types has changed. `functor` is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon. If you did rely on it let us know in this [PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/363565).
  - [`lib.types.enum`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-option-types-basic): Previously the `functor.payload` was the list of enum values directly. Now it is an attribute set containing the values in the `values` attribute.
  - [`lib.types.separatedString`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-option-types-string): Previously the `functor.payload` was the seperator directly. Now it is an attribute set containing the seperator in the `sep` attribute.
