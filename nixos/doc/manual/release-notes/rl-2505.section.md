- **This release of Nixpkgs requires macOS Big Sur 11.3 or newer, as announced in the 24.11 release notes.**
  We cannot guarantee that packages will continue to work on older versions of macOS.
  Future Nixpkgs releases will only support [macOS versions supported by Apple](https://endoflife.date/macos); this means that **Nixpkgs 25.11 will require macOS Sonoma 14 or newer**.
  Users on old macOS versions should consider upgrading to a supported version (potentially using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) for old hardware) or installing NixOS.
  If neither of those options are viable and you require new versions of software, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) supports versions back to Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.

- GCC has been updated from GCC 13 to GCC 14.
  This introduces some backwards‐incompatible changes; see the [upstream porting guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html) for details.

- LLVM has been updated from LLVM 16 (on Darwin) and LLVM 18 (on other platforms) to LLVM 19.
  This introduces some backwards‐incompatible changes; see the [upstream release notes](https://releases.llvm.org/) for details.

- The default PHP version has been updated to 8.3.

- The default Erlang OTP version has been updated to 27.

- The default Elixir version has been updated to 1.18.

- `buildPythonPackage`, `buildPythonApplication` and the Python building setup hooks now support both `__structuredAttrs = true` and `__structuredAttrs = false`.

- `services.dex` now restarts upon changes to the `.environmentFile` or entries in `.settings.staticClients[].secretFile` when the entry is a `path` type.

- `nixos-rebuild-ng`, a full rewrite of `nixos-rebuild` in Python, is available for testing. You can enable it by setting [system.rebuild.enableNg](options.html#opt-system.rebuild.enableNg) in your configuration (this will replace the old `nixos-rebuild`), or by adding `nixos-rebuild-ng` to your `environment.systemPackages` (in this case, it will live side-by-side with `nixos-rebuild` as `nixos-rebuild-ng`). It is expected that the next major version of NixOS (25.11) will enable `system.rebuild.enableNg` by default.
- A `nixos-rebuild build-image` sub-command has been added.

- `nixos-option` has been rewritten to a Nix expression called by a simple bash script. This lowers our maintenance threshold, makes eval errors less verbose, adds support for flake-based configurations, descending into `attrsOf` and `listOf` submodule options, and `--show-trace`.

  It allows users to build platform-specific (disk) images from their NixOS configurations. `nixos-rebuild build-image` works similar to the popular [nix-community/nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) project. See new [section on image building in the nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-image-nixos-rebuild-build-image).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-25.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `binwalk` was updated to 3.1.0, which has been rewritten in rust. The python module is no longer available.
  See the release notes of [3.1.0](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/releases/tag/v3.1.0) for more information.

- `buildGoModule` now passes environment variables via the `env` attribute. `CGO_ENABLED` should now be specified with `env.CGO_ENABLED` when passing to buildGoModule. Direct specification of `CGO_ENABLED` is now redirected by a compatibility layer with a warning, but will become an error in future releases.

  Go-related environment variables previously shadowed by `buildGoModule` now results in errors when specified directly. Such variables include `GOOS` and `GOARCH`.

  Third-party projects supporting both stable and unstable channels could detect this change through the absence of the `CGO_ENABLED` function argument in `buildGoModule` (`!((lib.functionArgs buildGoModule) ? CGO_ENABLED)`).

- `buildGoPackage` has been removed. Use `buildGoModule` instead. See the [Go section in the nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-language-go) for details.

- top-level `playwright` now refers to the github Microsoft/playwright package
  instead of the python tester launcher. You can still refer to the python
  launcher via `python3Packages.toPythonApplication python3Packages.playwright`

- The representation of the flags attributes as shell/environment variables for most Python building setup hooks are now the same as `stdenv.mkDerivation` and other build helpers -- they are space-separated environment variables when `__structuredAttrs = false` and Bash arrays when `__structuredAttrs = true`, and are concatenated to the command without Bash-evaluation. The following behaviour changes are introduced during the conversion:

  - The following flags are no longer Bash-expanded before concatenated to the command:
    - `disabledTests` and `disabledTestPaths` for `pytestCheckHook`. (`disabledTestPaths` used to be expanded twice before concatenation.)
    - `setupPyBuildFlags` and `setupPyGlobalFlags` for `setuptoolsBuildHook`.

  - `pytestFlags` and `unittestFlags` replace `pytestFlagsArray` and `unittestFlagsArray` and become the new and conforming interface.

  - `pytestFlagsArray` and `unittestFlagsArray` are kept for compatibility purposes. They continue to be Bash-expanded before concatenated. This compatibility layer will be removed in future releases.

- `strawberry` has been updated to 1.2, which drops support for the VLC backend and Qt 5. The `strawberry-qt5` package
  and `withGstreamer`/`withVlc` override options have been removed due to this.

- `ps3-disc-dumper` was updated to 4.2.5, which removed the CLI project and now exclusively offers the GUI

- [](#opt-services.nextcloud.config.dbtype) is unset by default, the previous default was `sqlite`.
  This was done because `sqlite` is not a reasonable default since it's
  [not recommended by upstream](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/30/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html)
  and thus doesn't qualify as default.

- Nextcloud's default FPM pool settings have been increased according to upstream recommentations. It's advised
  to review the new defaults and description of
  [](#opt-services.nextcloud.poolSettings).

- `kmonad` is now hardened by default using common `systemd` settings.
  If KMonad is used to execute shell commands, hardening may make some of them fail.  In that case, you can disable hardening using {option}`services.kmonad.keyboards.<name>.enableHardening` option.

- `asusd` has been upgraded to version 6 which supports multiple aura devices. To account for this, the single `auraConfig` configuration option has been replaced with `auraConfigs` which is an attribute set of config options per each device. The config files may also be now specified as either source files or text strings; to account for this you will need to specify that `text` is used for your existing configs, e.g.:
  ```diff
  -services.asusd.asusdConfig = '''file contents'''
  +services.asusd.asusdConfig.text = '''file contents'''
  ```

- `linuxPackages.nvidiaPackages.stable` now defaults to the `production` variant instead of `latest`.

- `timescaledb` requires manual upgrade steps.
    After you run ALTER EXTENSION, you must run [this SQL script](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-extras/blob/master/utils/2.15.X-fix_hypertable_foreign_keys.sql). For more details, see the following pull requests [#6797](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/pull/6797).
    PostgreSQL 13 is no longer supported in TimescaleDB v2.16.

- Support for CUDA 10 has been dropped, as announced in the 24.11 release notes.

- `zammad` has had its support for MySQL removed, since it was never working correctly and is now deprecated upstream. Check the [migration guide](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/appendix/migrate-to-postgresql.html) for how to convert your database to PostgreSQL.

- The `earlyoom` service is now using upstream systemd service, which enables
  hardening and filesystem isolation by default. If you need filesystem write
  access or want to access home directory via `killHook`, hardening setting can
  be changed via, e.g. `systemd.services.earlyoom.serviceConfig.ProtectSystem`.

  `services.earlyoom.extraArgs` is now shell-escaped for each element without
  word-breaking. So you want to write `extraArgs = [ "--prefer" "spaced pat" ]`
  rather than previous `extraArgs = [ "--prefer 'spaced pat'" ]`.

- `nodePackages.vls` has been deprecated, as the upstream consumer of it, vetur, has been deprecated by upstream. Upstream suggests migrating to Volar for Vue LSP tooling instead.

- `nodePackages.create-react-native-app` has been removed, as it is deprecated. Upstream suggests using a framework for React Native apps instead.

- `nodePackages.insect` has been removed, as it's deprecated by upstream. The suggested replacement is `numbat`.

- `nodePackages.webpack-dev-server` has been removed, as it should be installed in projects that use it instead.

- `nodePackages.copy-webpack-plugin` has been removed, as it should be installed in projects that use it instead.

- `himalaya` has been updated from `v1.0.0-beta.4` to `v1.1.0`, which introduces breaking changes. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya/releases) for details.

- `linuxPackages.nvidiaPackages.dc_520` has been removed since it is marked broken and there are better newer alternatives.

- `programs.less.lessopen` is now null by default. To restore the previous behaviour, set it to `''|${lib.getExe' pkgs.lesspipe "lesspipe.sh"} %s''`.

- `hardware.pulseaudio` has been renamed to `services.pulseaudio`.  The deprecated option names will continue to work, but causes a warning.

- `minetest` has been renamed to `luanti` to match the upstream name change but aliases have been added. The new name hasn't resulted in many changes as of yet but older references to minetest should be sunset. See the [new name announcement](https://blog.minetest.net/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/) for more details.

- `racket_7_9` has been removed, as it is insecure. It is recommended to use Racket 8 instead.

- `rofi` has been updated from 1.7.5 to 1.7.6 which introduces some breaking changes to binary plugins, and also contains a lot of new features and bug fixes. This is highlighted because the patch version bump does not indicate the volume of changes by itself. See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/releases/tag/1.7.6) for the full list of changes.

- `ente-auth` now uses the name `enteauth` for its binary. The previous name was `ente_auth`.

- `foundationdb` was upgraded to 7.3.

- `fluxus` has been removed, as it depends on `racket_7_9` and had no updates in 9 years.

- `sm64ex-coop` has been removed as it was archived upstream. Consider migrating to `sm64coopdx`.

- `renovate` was updated to v39. See the [upstream release notes](https://docs.renovatebot.com/release-notes-for-major-versions/#version-39) for breaking changes.
  Like upstream's docker images, renovate now runs on NodeJS 22.

- The behavior of the `networking.nat.externalIP` and `networking.nat.externalIPv6` options has been changed. `networking.nat.forwardPorts` now only forwards packets destined for the specified IP addresses.

- `python3Packages.jaeger-client` was removed because it was deprecated upstream. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is the recommended replacement.

- `nodePackages.meshcommander` has been removed, as the package was deprecated by Intel.

- `kanata` was updated to v1.7.0, which introduces several breaking changes.
  See the release notes of
  [v1.7.0](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
  for more information.

- `nodePackages.expo-cli` has been removed, as it was deprecated by upstream. The suggested replacement is the `npx expo` command.

- DokuWiki with the Caddy webserver (`services.dokuwiki.webserver = "caddy"`) now sets up sites with Caddy's automatic HTTPS instead of HTTP-only.
  To keep the old behavior for a site `example.com`, set `services.caddy.virtualHosts."example.com".hostName = "http://example.com"`.
  If you set custom Caddy options for a DokuWiki site, migrate these options by removing `http://` from `services.caddy.virtualHosts."http://example.com"`.

- `vscode-utils.buildVscodeExtension` now requires pname as an argument

- The behavior of `services.hostapd.radios.<name>.networks.<name>.authentication.enableRecommendedPairwiseCiphers` was changed to not include `CCMP-256` anymore.
  Since all configured pairwise ciphers have to be supported by the radio, this caused startup failures on many devices which is hard to debug in hostapd.

- `nerdfonts` has been separated into individual font packages under the namespace `nerd-fonts`. The directories for font
  files have changed from `$out/share/fonts/{opentype,truetype}/NerdFonts` to
  `$out/share/fonts/{opentype,truetype}/NerdFonts/<fontDirName>`, where `<fontDirName>` can be found in the
  [official website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) as the titles in preview images, with the "Nerd Font"
  suffix and any whitespaces trimmed. Configuration changes are required, see build output.

- `retroarch` has been refactored and the older `retroarch.override { cores = [ ... ]; }` to create a RetroArch derivation with custom cores doesn't work anymore, use `retroarch.withCores (cores: [ ... ])` instead. If you need more customization (e.g.: custom settings), use `wrapRetroArch` instead.

- `gkraken` software and `hardware.gkraken.enable` option have been removed, use `coolercontrol` via `programs.coolercontrol.enable` option instead.

- To avoid delaying user logins unnecessarily the `multi-user.target` is no longer ordered after `network-online.target`.
  System services requiring a connection to start correctly must explicitly state so, i.e.
  ```nix
  systemd.services.<name> = {
    wants = [ "network-online.target" ];
    after = [ "network-online.target" ];
  };
  ```
  This changed follows a deprecation period of one year started in NixOS 24.05 (see [PR #283818](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/283818)).

- The values of `services.borgbackup.jobs.*.extraArgs` and other `extra*Args` options are now represented as Bash arrays. If these arguments were modified using `services.borgbackup.jobs.*.preHook`, they will need to be adjusted to append to these arrays, i.e.
  ```diff
  -extraCreateArgs="$extraCreateArgs --exclude /some/path"
  +extraCreateArgs+=("--exclude" "/some/path")
  ```

- `nodePackages.ganache` has been removed, as the package has been deprecated by upstream.

- `virtualisation.azure.agent` option provided by `azure-agent.nix` is replaced by `services.waagent`, and will be removed in a future release.

- `matomo` now defaults to version 5 (previously available as `matomo_5`). Version 4 has been removed as it reached EOL on December 19, 2024.

- `docker_24` has been removed, as it was EOL with vulnerabilites since June 08, 2024.

- `containerd` has been updated to v2, which contains breaking changes. See the [containerd
  2.0](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/containerd-2.0.md) documentation for more
  details.

- The ZFS import service now respects `fileSystems.*.options = [ "noauto" ];` and does not add that pool's import service to `zfs-import.target`, meaning it will not be automatically imported at boot.

- `nodePackages.stackdriver-statsd-backend` has been removed, as the StackDriver service has been discontinued by Google, and therefore the package no longer works.

- `python3Packages.opentracing` has been removed due to being unmaintained upstream. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is the recommended replacement.

- Default file names of images generated by several builders in `system.build` have been changed as outlined in the table below.

  Names are now known at evaluation time and customizable via the new options `image.baseName`, `image.extension`, `image.fileName` and `image.filePath` with the latter returning a path relative to the derivations out path (e.g. `iso/${image.fileName` for iso images).

- `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.enforce` and `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.enable` were removed.
  Configuring the state of apparmor policies must now be done using `security.apparmor.policies.<name>.state` tristate option.

- the notmuch vim plugin now lives in a separate output of the `notmuch`
  package. Installing `notmuch` will not bring the notmuch vim package anymore,
  add `vimPlugins.notmuch-vim` to your (Neo)vim configuration if you want the
  vim plugin.

- `prisma` and `prisma-engines` have been updated to version 6.0.1, which
  introduces several breaking changes. See the
  [Prisma ORM upgrade guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-6)
  for more information.

- `nq` was updated to 1.0, which renames the `fq` and `tq` utilities to `nqtail` and `nqterm` respectively.

- `zf` was updated to 0.10.2, which includes breaking changes from the [0.10.0 release](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf/releases/tag/0.10.0).
  `zf` no longer does Unicode normalization of the input and no longer supports terminal escape sequences in the `ZF_PROMPT` environment variable.

- `programs.clash-verge.tunMode` was deprecated and removed because now service mode is neccessary to start program. Without `programs.clash-verge.enable`, clash-verge-rev will refuse to start.

- `siduck76-st` has been renamed to `st-snazzy`, like the project's [flake](https://github.com/siduck/st/blob/main/flake.nix).

- `python3Packages.jax` now directly depends on `python3Packages.jaxlib`.
  As a result, packages that depend on jax no longer need to include jaxlib to their dependencies.
  There is also a breaking change in the handling of CUDA. Instead of using a CUDA compatible jaxlib
  as before, you can use plugins like `python3Packages.jax-cuda12-plugin`.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-25.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Cinnamon has been updated to 6.4, please check the [upstream announcement](https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_xia_whatsnew.php) for more details.
  - Following [changes in Mint 22](https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupgrade/commit/f239cde908288b8c250f938e7311c7ffbc16bd59) we are no longer overriding Qt application styles. You can still restore the previous default with `qt.style = "gtk2"` and `qt.platformTheme = "gtk2"`.
  - Following [changes in Mint 20](https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupgrade-legacy/commit/ce15d946ed9a8cb8444abd25088edd824bfb18f6) we are replacing xplayer with celluloid since xplayer is no longer maintained.

- Pantheon has been updated to 8, please check the [upstream announcement](https://blog.elementary.io/os-8-available-now/) for more details.
  - Same as elementary OS, the X11 session is named "Classic Session" and the Wayland session is named "Secure Session".
  - The dock has been rewritten, you need to manually migrate the dock items on update. You can check `~/.config/plank/dock1/launchers/` for your previous settings.

- Xfce has been updated to 4.20, please check the [upstream feature tour](https://www.xfce.org/about/tour420) for more details.
  - Wayland session is still [experimental](https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/wayland_roadmap) and requires opt-in using `enableWaylandSession` option.
  - Overriding Wayland compositor is possible using `enableWaylandSession` option, but you might need to take care [`xfce4-session`](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/-/merge_requests/49), [`dbus-update-activation-environment`](https://github.com/labwc/labwc/blob/eaf11face68ee1f1bcc7ce1498304ca8c108c8ba/src/config/session.c#L234) and [`systemctl --user import-environment`](https://github.com/labwc/labwc/blob/eaf11face68ee1f1bcc7ce1498304ca8c108c8ba/src/config/session.c#L239) on startup.
  - For new Xfce installations, default panel layout has [changed](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/-/merge_requests/158/diffs) to not include external panel plugins by default. You can still add them yourself using the "Panel Preferences" dialog.

- GOverlay has been updated to 1.2, please check the [upstream changelog](https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/releases) for more details.

- [`services.jupyter`](#opt-services.jupyter.enable) is now compatible with `Jupyter Notebook 7`. See [the migration guide](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrate_to_notebook7.html) for details.

- `networking.wireguard` now has an optional networkd backend. It is enabled by default when `networking.useNetworkd` is enabled, and it can be enabled alongside scripted networking with `networking.wireguard.useNetworkd`. Some `networking.wireguard` options have slightly different behavior with the networkd and script-based backends, documented in each option.

- `services.avahi.ipv6` now defaults to true.

- For matrix homeserver Synapse we are now following the upstream recommendation to enable jemalloc as the memory allocator by default.

- `services.kmonad` now creates a determinate symlink (in `/dev/input/by-id/`) to each of KMonad virtual devices.

- `bind.cacheNetworks` now only controls access for recursive queries, where it previously controlled access for all queries.

- The paperless module now has an option for regular automatic export of
  documents data using the integrated document exporter.

- Caddy can now be built with plugins by using `caddy.withPlugins`, a `passthru` function that accepts an attribute set as a parameter. The `plugins` argument represents a list of Caddy plugins, with each Caddy plugin being a versioned module. The `hash` argument represents the `vendorHash` of the resulting Caddy source code with the plugins added.

  Example:
  ```nix
  services.caddy = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.caddy.withPlugins {
      plugins = [
        # tagged upstream
        "github.com/caddy-dns/powerdns@v1.0.1"
        # pseudo-version number generated by Go
        "github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare@v0.0.0-20240703190432-89f16b99c18e"
        "github.com/mholt/caddy-webdav@v0.0.0-20241008162340-42168ba04c9d"
      ];
      hash = "sha256-wqXSd1Ep9TVpQi570TTb96LwzNYvWL5EBJXMJfYWCAk=";
    };
  };
  ```

  To get the necessary hash of the vendored dependencies, omit `hash`. The build will fail and tell you the correct value.

  Note that all provided plugins must have versions/tags (string after `@`), even if upstream repo does not tag each release. For untagged plugins, you can either create an empty Go project and run `go get <plugin>` and see changes in `go.mod` to get the pseudo-version number, or provide a commit hash in place of version/tag for the first run, and update the plugin string based on the error output.

- KDE Partition Manager `partitionmanager`'s support for ReiserFS is removed.
  ReiserFS has not been actively maintained for many years. It has been marked as obsolete since Linux 6.6, and
  [is removed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c01f664e4ca210823b7594b50669bbd9b0a3c3b0)
  in Linux 6.13.

- `programs.fzf.keybindings` now supports the fish shell.

- `gerbera` now has wavpack support.
