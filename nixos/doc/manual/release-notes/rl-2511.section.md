# Release 25.11 ("Xantusia", 2025.11/??) {#sec-release-25.11}

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.11-highlights}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Secure boot support can now be enabled for the Limine bootloader through {option}`boot.loader.limine.secureBoot.enable`. Bootloader install script signs the bootloader, then kernels are hashed during system rebuild and written to a config. This allows Limine to boot only the kernels installed through NixOS system.

## New Modules {#sec-release-25.11-new-modules}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- [encrypted-dns-server](https://github.com/dnscrypt/encrypted-dns-server), a DoH and DNSCrypt server. Available as [services.encrypted-dns-server](#opt-services.encrypted-dns-server.enable).

- [gtklock](https://github.com/jovanlanik/gtklock), a GTK-based lockscreen for Wayland. Available as [programs.gtklock](#opt-programs.gtklock.enable).

- [SuiteNumérique Docs](https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs), a collaborative note taking, wiki and documentation web platform and alternative to Notion or Outline. Available as [services.lasuite-docs](#opt-services.lasuite-docs.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-25.11-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The `services.polipo` module has been removed as `polipo` is unmaintained and archived upstream.

- `renovate` was updated to v40. See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/releases/tag/40.0.0) for breaking changes.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-25.11-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.clamsmtp` is unmaintained and was removed from Nixpkgs.

- `amdgpu` kernel driver overdrive mode can now be enabled by setting [hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.enable](#opt-hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.enable) and customized through [hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.ppfeaturemask](#opt-hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.ppfeaturemask).
  This allows for fine-grained control over the GPU's performance and maybe required by overclocking softwares like Corectrl and Lact. These new options replace old options such as {option}`programs.corectrl.gpuOverclock.enable` and {option}`programs.tuxclocker.enableAMD`.
