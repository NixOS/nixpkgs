# Release 25.11 ("Xantusia", 2025.11/??) {#sec-release-25.11}

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.11-highlights}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Secure boot support can now be enabled for the Limine bootloader through {option}`boot.loader.limine.secureBoot.enable`. Bootloader install script signs the bootloader, then kernels are hashed during system rebuild and written to a config. This allows Limine to boot only the kernels installed through NixOS system.
