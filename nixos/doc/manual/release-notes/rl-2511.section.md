# Release 25.11 ("Xantusia", 2025.11/??) {#sec-release-25.11}

## Highlights {#sec-release-25.11-highlights}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `nixos-rebuild-ng`, a full rewrite of `nixos-rebuild` in Python, is enabled by default from this release. You can disable it by setting [](#opt-system.rebuild.enableNg) to `false` in your configuration if you need, but please report any issues. It is expected that the next major version of NixOS (26.05) will remove the {option}`system.rebuild.enableNg` option.

- Secure boot support can now be enabled for the Limine bootloader through {option}`boot.loader.limine.secureBoot.enable`. Bootloader install script signs the bootloader, then kernels are hashed during system rebuild and written to a config. This allows Limine to boot only the kernels installed through NixOS system.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-25.11-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The `services.polipo` module has been removed as `polipo` is unmaintained and archived upstream.

- The Pocket ID module ([`services.pocket-id`][#opt-services.pocket-id.enable]) and package (`pocket-id`) has been updated to 1.0.0. Some environment variables have been changed or removed, see the [migration guide](https://pocket-id.org/docs/setup/migrate-to-v1/).

- The `yeahwm` package and `services.xserver.windowManager.yeahwm` module were removed due to the package being broken and unmaintained upstream.

- The `services.siproxd` module has been removed as `siproxd` is unmaintained and broken with libosip 5.x.

- `services.dwm-status.extraConfig` was replaced by [RFC0042](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-config-option.md)-compliant [](#opt-services.dwm-status.settings), which is used to generate the config file. `services.dwm-status.order` is now moved to [](#opt-services.dwm-status.settings.order), as it's a part of the config file.

- `renovate` was updated to v40. See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/releases/tag/40.0.0) for breaking changes.

- The Postfix module has been updated and likely requires configuration changes:
  - The `services.postfix.sslCert` and `sslKey` options were removed and you now need to configure
    - [services.postfix.config.smtpd_tls_chain_files](#opt-services.postfix.config.smtpd_tls_chain_files) for server certificates,
    - [services.postfix.config.smtp_tls_chain_files](#opt-services.postfix.config) for client certificates.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-25.11-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.clamsmtp` is unmaintained and was removed from Nixpkgs.

- `services.dnscrypt-proxy2` gains a `package` option to specify dnscrypt-proxy package to use.

- `amdgpu` kernel driver overdrive mode can now be enabled by setting [hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.enable](#opt-hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.enable) and customized through [hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.ppfeaturemask](#opt-hardware.amdgpu.overdrive.ppfeaturemask).
  This allows for fine-grained control over the GPU's performance and maybe required by overclocking softwares like Corectrl and Lact. These new options replace old options such as {option}`programs.corectrl.gpuOverclock.enable` and {option}`programs.tuxclocker.enableAMD`.

- [](#opt-services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable) does not ship with an SSH agent anymore, as this is now handled by the `gcr_4` package instead of `gnome-keyring`. A new module has been added to support this, under [](#opt-services.gnome.gcr-ssh-agent.enable) (its default value has been set to [](#opt-services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable) to ensure a smooth transition). See the [relevant upstream PR](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gcr/-/merge_requests/67) for more details.
