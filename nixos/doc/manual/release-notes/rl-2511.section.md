## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-25.11-incompatibilities}

- The setting [`services.xserver.config`](#opt-services.xserver.config) now has a changed order, so that if the user sets this option, their config is rendered _after_ NixOS's default Xorg config.
  This is because in `xorg.conf`, later sections have precedence, and we usually want the user section to take precedence (otherwise the user settings may be silently ignored, see example from [#127166](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/127166)).

  There may be unlikely user configurations that rely on the user config being overridden. If you have such a config, use `services.xserver.config = lib.mkBefore ...` on your config to invoke the old behaviour.
