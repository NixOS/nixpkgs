## Highlights {#sec-release-22.05-highlights}

## New Services {#sec-release-22.05-new-services}

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-22.05-incompatibilities}

* `pkgs.ghc` now refers to `pkgs.targetPackages.haskellPackages.ghc`.
  This *only* makes a difference if you are cross-compiling and will
  ensure that `pkgs.ghc` always runs on the host platform and compiles
  for the target platform (similar to `pkgs.gcc` for example).
  `haskellPackages.ghc` still behaves as before, running on the build
  platform and compiling for the host platform (similar to `stdenv.cc`).
  This means you don't have to adjust your derivations if you use
  `haskellPackages.callPackage`, but when using `pkgs.callPackage` and
  taking `ghc` as an input, you should now use `buildPackages.ghc`
  instead to ensure cross compilation keeps working (or switch to
  `haskellPackages.callPackage`).

* `pkgs.emacsPackages.orgPackages` is removed because org elpa is deprecated.
  The packages in the top level of `pkgs.emacsPackages`, such as org and
  org-contrib, refer to the ones in `pkgs.emacsPackages.elpaPackages` and
  `pkgs.emacsPackages.nongnuPackages` where the new versions will release.
