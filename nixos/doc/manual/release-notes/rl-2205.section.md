# Release 22.05 (“Quokka”, 2022.05/??) {#sec-release-22.05}

In addition to numerous new and upgraded packages, this release has the following highlights:

- Support is planned until the end of December 2022, handing over to 22.11.

## Highlights {#sec-release-22.05-highlights}

## New Services {#sec-release-22.05-new-services}

- [aesmd](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx#install-the-intelr-sgx-psw), the Intel SGX Architectural Enclave Service Manager. Available as [services.aesmd](#opt-services.aesmd.enable).

- [filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-overview.html), a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data. Available as [services.filebeat](#opt-services.filebeat.enable).

- [PowerDNS-Admin](https://github.com/ngoduykhanh/PowerDNS-Admin), a web interface for the PowerDNS server. Available at [services.powerdns-admin](options.html#opt-services.powerdns-admin.enable).

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-release-22.05-incompatibilities}

- `pkgs.ghc` now refers to `pkgs.targetPackages.haskellPackages.ghc`.
  This *only* makes a difference if you are cross-compiling and will
  ensure that `pkgs.ghc` always runs on the host platform and compiles
  for the target platform (similar to `pkgs.gcc` for example).
  `haskellPackages.ghc` still behaves as before, running on the build
  platform and compiling for the host platform (similar to `stdenv.cc`).
  This means you don't have to adjust your derivations if you use
  `haskellPackages.callPackage`, but when using `pkgs.callPackage` and
  taking `ghc` as an input, you should now use `buildPackages.ghc`
  instead to ensure cross compilation keeps working (or switch to
  `haskellPackages.callPackage`).

- `pkgs.emacsPackages.orgPackages` is removed because org elpa is deprecated.
  The packages in the top level of `pkgs.emacsPackages`, such as org and
  org-contrib, refer to the ones in `pkgs.emacsPackages.elpaPackages` and
  `pkgs.emacsPackages.nongnuPackages` where the new versions will release.

- The `wafHook` hook now honors `NIX_BUILD_CORES` when `enableParallelBuilding` is not set explicitly. Packages can restore the old behaviour by setting `enableParallelBuilding=false`.

- `pkgs.claws-mail-gtk2`, representing Claws Mail's older release version three, was removed in order to get rid of Python 2.
  Please switch to `claws-mail`, which is Claws Mail's latest release based on GTK+3 and Python 3.

- The `writers.writePython2` and corresponding `writers.writePython2Bin` convenience functions to create executable Python 2 scripts in the store were removed in preparation of removal of the Python 2 interpreter.
  Scripts have to be converted to Python 3 for use with `writers.writePython3` or `writers.writePyPy2` needs to be used.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-release-22.05-notable-changes}

- The option [services.redis.servers](#opt-services.redis.servers) was added
  to support per-application `redis-server` which is more secure since Redis databases
  are only mere key prefixes without any configuration or ACL of their own.
  Backward-compatibility is preserved by mapping old `services.redis.settings`
  to `services.redis.servers."".settings`, but you are strongly encouraged
  to name each `redis-server` instance after the application using it,
  instead of keeping that nameless one.
  Except for the nameless `services.redis.servers.""`
  still accessible at `127.0.0.1:6379`,
  and to the members of the Unix group `redis`
  through the Unix socket `/run/redis/redis.sock`,
  all other `services.redis.servers.${serverName}`
  are only accessible by default
  to the members of the Unix group `redis-${serverName}`
  through the Unix socket `/run/redis-${serverName}/redis.sock`.

- The `writers.writePyPy2`/`writers.writePyPy3` and corresponding `writers.writePyPy2Bin`/`writers.writePyPy3Bin` convenience functions to create executable Python 2/3 scripts using the PyPy interpreter were added.

- The `influxdb2` package was split into `influxdb2-server` and
  `influxdb2-cli`, matching the split that took place upstream. A
  combined `influxdb2` package is still provided in this release for
  backwards compatibilty, but will be removed at a later date.
