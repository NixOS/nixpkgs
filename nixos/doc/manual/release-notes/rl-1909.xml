  <title>Backward Incompatibilities</title>

  <para>
   When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the following
   incompatible changes:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Buildbot no longer supports Python 2, as support was dropped upstream in
     version 2.0.0. Configurations may need to be modified to make them
     compatible with Python 3.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     PostgreSQL now uses
     <filename class="directory">/run/postgresql</filename> as its socket
     directory instead of <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>. So
     if you run an application like eg. Nextcloud, where you need to use
     the Unix socket path as the database host name, you need to change it
     accordingly.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The options <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.user</option> and
      <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.group</option> have been removed
      because the alertmanager service is now using systemd's <link
      xlink:href="http://0pointer.net/blog/dynamic-users-with-systemd.html">
      DynamicUser mechanism</link> which obviates these options.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The NetworkManager systemd unit was renamed back from network-manager.service to
      NetworkManager.service for better compatibility with other applications expecting this name.
      The same applies to ModemManager where modem-manager.service is now called ModemManager.service again.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.nzbget.configFile</option> and <option>services.nzbget.openFirewall</option>
      options were removed as they are managed internally by the nzbget. The
      <option>services.nzbget.dataDir</option> option hadn't actually been used by
      the module for some time and so was removed as cleanup.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.mysql.pidDir</option> option was removed, as it was only used by the wordpress
      apache-httpd service to wait for mysql to have started up.
      This can be accomplished by either describing a dependency on mysql.service (preferred)
      or waiting for the (hardcoded) <filename>/run/mysqld/mysql.sock</filename> file to appear.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.emby.enable</option> module has been removed, see
      <option>services.jellyfin.enable</option> instead for a free software fork of Emby.

      See the Jellyfin documentation:

     Since Bittorrent Sync was superseded by Resilio Sync in 2016, the
     <literal>bittorrentSync</literal>, <literal>bittorrentSync14</literal>,
     and <literal>bittorrentSync16</literal> packages have been removed in
     favor of <literal>resilio-sync</literal>.

    <para>
     The corresponding module, <option>services.btsync</option> has been
     replaced by the <option>services.resilio</option> module.

    <para>
      The limesurvey apache subservice was replaced with a full NixOS module.
      One can configure it using the <option>services.limesurvey.enable</option>
      and <option>services.limesurvey.virtualHost</option> options.

      The setopt declarations will be evaluated at the end of <literal>/etc/zshrc</literal>, so any code in <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.interactiveShellInit" />,
      <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.loginShellInit" /> and <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.promptInit" /> may break if it relies on those options being set.

  <title>Other Notable Changes</title>

    <para>
     The <option>documentation</option> module gained an option named
     <option>documentation.nixos.includeAllModules</option> which makes the
     generated <citerefentry>
     <refentrytitle>configuration.nix</refentrytitle>
     <manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> manual page include all options
     from all NixOS modules included in a given
     <literal>configuration.nix</literal> configuration file. Currently, it is
     set to <literal>false</literal> by default as enabling it frequently
     prevents evaluation. But the plan is to eventually have it set to
     <literal>true</literal> by default. Please set it to
     <literal>true</literal> now in your <literal>configuration.nix</literal>
     and fix all the bugs it uncovers.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <literal>vlc</literal> package gained support for Chromecast
     streaming, enabled by default. TCP port 8010 must be open for it to work,
     so something like <literal>networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 8010
     ];</literal> may be required in your configuration. Also consider enabling
     <link xlink:href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Accelerated_Video_Playback">
     Accelerated Video Playback</link> for better transcoding performance.

     The following changes apply if the <literal>stateVersion</literal> is
     changed to 19.09 or higher. For <literal>stateVersion = "19.03"</literal>
     or lower the old behavior is preserved.

      The <literal>hunspellDicts.fr-any</literal> dictionary now ships with <literal>fr_FR.{aff,dic}</literal>
      which is linked to <literal>fr-toutesvariantes.{aff,dic}</literal>.

      The <literal>mysql</literal> service now runs as <literal>mysql</literal>
      user. Previously, systemd did execute it as root, and mysql dropped privileges
      itself.
      This includes <literal>ExecStartPre=</literal> and
      <literal>ExecStartPost=</literal> phases.
      To accomplish that, runtime and data directory setup was delegated to
      RuntimeDirectory and tmpfiles.

      Since version 0.1.19, <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> honors package
      includes that are specified in the <filename>Cargo.toml</filename>
      file of Rust crates. <literal>rustPlatform.buildRustPackage</literal> uses
      <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> to collect and build dependent crates.
      Since this change in <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> changes the set of
      vendored files for most Rust packages, the hash that use used to verify
      the dependencies, <literal>cargoSha256</literal>, also changes.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <literal>cargoSha256</literal> hashes of all in-tree derivations that
      use <literal>buildRustPackage</literal> have been updated to reflect this
      change. However, third-party derivations that use
      <literal>buildRustPackage</literal> may have to be updated as well.
