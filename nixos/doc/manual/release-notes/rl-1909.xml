  <title>Backward Incompatibilities</title>

  <para>
   When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the following
   incompatible changes:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Buildbot no longer supports Python 2, as support was dropped upstream in
     version 2.0.0. Configurations may need to be modified to make them
     compatible with Python 3.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     PostgreSQL now uses
     <filename class="directory">/run/postgresql</filename> as its socket
     directory instead of <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>. So
     if you run an application like eg. Nextcloud, where you need to use
     the Unix socket path as the database host name, you need to change it
     accordingly.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The options <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.user</option> and
      <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.group</option> have been removed
      because the alertmanager service is now using systemd's <link
      xlink:href="http://0pointer.net/blog/dynamic-users-with-systemd.html">
      DynamicUser mechanism</link> which obviates these options.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The NetworkManager systemd unit was renamed back from network-manager.service to
      NetworkManager.service for better compatibility with other applications expecting this name.
      The same applies to ModemManager where modem-manager.service is now called ModemManager.service again.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.nzbget.configFile</option> and <option>services.nzbget.openFirewall</option>
      options were removed as they are managed internally by the nzbget. The
      <option>services.nzbget.dataDir</option> option hadn't actually been used by
      the module for some time and so was removed as cleanup.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.mysql.pidDir</option> option was removed, as it was only used by the wordpress
      apache-httpd service to wait for mysql to have started up.
      This can be accomplished by either describing a dependency on mysql.service (preferred)
      or waiting for the (hardcoded) <filename>/run/mysqld/mysql.sock</filename> file to appear.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The <option>services.emby.enable</option> module has been removed, see
      <option>services.jellyfin.enable</option> instead for a free software fork of Emby.

      See the Jellyfin documentation:

     Since Bittorrent Sync was superseded by Resilio Sync in 2016, the
     <literal>bittorrentSync</literal>, <literal>bittorrentSync14</literal>,
     and <literal>bittorrentSync16</literal> packages have been removed in
     favor of <literal>resilio-sync</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The corresponding module, <option>services.btsync</option> has been
     replaced by the <option>services.resilio</option> module.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Several of the apache subservices have been replaced with full NixOS
      modules including LimeSurvey and WordPress.
      These modules can be enabled using the <option>services.limesurvey.enable</option>
      and <option>services.wordpress.enable</option> options.
    </para>

   <listitem>
     <para>
      The option <option>systemd.network.networks.&lt;name&gt;.routes.*.routeConfig.GatewayOnlink</option>
      was renamed to <option>systemd.network.networks.&lt;name&gt;.routes.*.routeConfig.GatewayOnLink</option>
      (capital <literal>L</literal>). This follows

    <para>
      As of this release the NixOps feature <literal>autoLuks</literal> is deprecated. It no longer works
      with our systemd version without manual intervention.
    </para>
    <para>
      Whenever the usage of the module is detected the evaluation will fail with a message
      explaining why and how to deal with the situation.
    </para>
    <para>
      A new knob named <literal>nixops.enableDeprecatedAutoLuks</literal>
      has been introduced to disable the eval failure and to acknowledge the notice was received and read.
      If you plan on using the feature please note that it might break with subsequent updates.
    </para>
    <para>
      Make sure you set the <literal>_netdev</literal> option for each of the file systems referring to block
      devices provided by the autoLuks module. Not doing this might render the system in a
      state where it doesn't boot anymore.
    </para>

      If you are actively using the <literal>autoLuks</literal> module please let us know in

    <para>
      The setopt declarations will be evaluated at the end of <literal>/etc/zshrc</literal>, so any code in <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.interactiveShellInit" />,
      <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.loginShellInit" /> and <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.promptInit" /> may break if it relies on those options being set.

  <title>Other Notable Changes</title>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <option>documentation</option> module gained an option named
     <option>documentation.nixos.includeAllModules</option> which makes the
     generated <citerefentry>
     <refentrytitle>configuration.nix</refentrytitle>
     <manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> manual page include all options
     from all NixOS modules included in a given
     <literal>configuration.nix</literal> configuration file. Currently, it is
     set to <literal>false</literal> by default as enabling it frequently
     prevents evaluation. But the plan is to eventually have it set to
     <literal>true</literal> by default. Please set it to
     <literal>true</literal> now in your <literal>configuration.nix</literal>
     and fix all the bugs it uncovers.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <literal>vlc</literal> package gained support for Chromecast
     streaming, enabled by default. TCP port 8010 must be open for it to work,
     so something like <literal>networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 8010
     ];</literal> may be required in your configuration. Also consider enabling
     <link xlink:href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Accelerated_Video_Playback">
     Accelerated Video Playback</link> for better transcoding performance.

     The following changes apply if the <literal>stateVersion</literal> is
     changed to 19.09 or higher. For <literal>stateVersion = "19.03"</literal>
     or lower the old behavior is preserved.

    <para>
      The <literal>mysql</literal> service now runs as <literal>mysql</literal>
      user. Previously, systemd did execute it as root, and mysql dropped privileges
      itself.
      This includes <literal>ExecStartPre=</literal> and
      <literal>ExecStartPost=</literal> phases.
      To accomplish that, runtime and data directory setup was delegated to
      RuntimeDirectory and tmpfiles.

    <para>
      With the upgrade to systemd version 242 the <literal>systemd-timesyncd</literal>
      service is no longer using <literal>DynamicUser=yes</literal>. In order for the
      upgrade to work we rely on an activation script to move the state from the old
      to the new directory. The older directory (prior <literal>19.09</literal>) was
      <literal>/var/lib/private/systemd/timesync</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      As long as the <literal>system.config.stateVersion</literal> is below
      <literal>19.09</literal> the state folder will migrated to its proper location
      (<literal>/var/lib/systemd/timesync</literal>), if required.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
     The package <literal>avahi</literal> is now built to look up service
     definitions from <literal>/etc/avahi/services</literal> instead of its
     output directory in the nix store. Accordingly the module
     <option>avahi</option> now supports custom service definitions via
     <option>services.avahi.extraServiceFiles</option>, which are then placed
     in the aforementioned directory. See <citerefentry>
     <refentrytitle>avahi.service</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
     </citerefentry> for more information on custom service definitions.
      Since version 0.1.19, <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> honors package
      includes that are specified in the <filename>Cargo.toml</filename>
      file of Rust crates. <literal>rustPlatform.buildRustPackage</literal> uses
      <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> to collect and build dependent crates.
      Since this change in <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> changes the set of
      vendored files for most Rust packages, the hash that use used to verify
      the dependencies, <literal>cargoSha256</literal>, also changes.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>cargoSha256</literal> hashes of all in-tree derivations that
      use <literal>buildRustPackage</literal> have been updated to reflect this
      change. However, third-party derivations that use
      <literal>buildRustPackage</literal> may have to be updated as well.

    <para>
      The <literal>consul</literal> package was upgraded past version <literal>1.5</literal>,
      so its deprecated legacy UI is no longer available.

    <para>
      The default resample-method for PulseAudio has been changed from the upstream default <literal>speex-float-1</literal>
      to <literal>speex-float-5</literal>. Be aware that low-powered ARM-based and MIPS-based boards will struggle with this
      so you'll need to set <option>hardware.pulseaudio.daemon.config.resample-method</option> back to <literal>speex-float-1</literal>.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <literal>phabricator</literal> package and associated <literal>httpd.extraSubservice</literal>, as well as the
