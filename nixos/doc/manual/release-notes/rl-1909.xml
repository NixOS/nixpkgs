  <title>Backward Incompatibilities</title>

  <para>
   When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the following
   incompatible changes:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Buildbot no longer supports Python 2, as support was dropped upstream in
     version 2.0.0. Configurations may need to be modified to make them
     compatible with Python 3.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     PostgreSQL now uses
     <filename class="directory">/run/postgresql</filename> as its socket
     directory instead of <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>. So
     if you run an application like eg. Nextcloud, where you need to use
     the Unix socket path as the database host name, you need to change it
     accordingly.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The options <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.user</option> and
     <option>services.prometheus.alertmanager.group</option> have been removed
     because the alertmanager service is now using systemd's <link
     xlink:href="http://0pointer.net/blog/dynamic-users-with-systemd.html">
     DynamicUser mechanism</link> which obviates these options.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The NetworkManager systemd unit was renamed back from network-manager.service to
     NetworkManager.service for better compatibility with other applications expecting this name.
     The same applies to ModemManager where modem-manager.service is now called ModemManager.service again.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <option>services.nzbget.configFile</option> and <option>services.nzbget.openFirewall</option>
     options were removed as they are managed internally by the nzbget. The
     <option>services.nzbget.dataDir</option> option hadn't actually been used by
     the module for some time and so was removed as cleanup.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <option>services.mysql.pidDir</option> option was removed, as it was only used by the wordpress
     apache-httpd service to wait for mysql to have started up.
     This can be accomplished by either describing a dependency on mysql.service (preferred)
     or waiting for the (hardcoded) <filename>/run/mysqld/mysql.sock</filename> file to appear.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <option>services.emby.enable</option> module has been removed, see
     <option>services.jellyfin.enable</option> instead for a free software fork of Emby.

     See the Jellyfin documentation:

    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>
     IPv6 Privacy Extensions are now enabled by default for undeclared
     interfaces. The previous behaviour was quite misleading — even though
     the default value for
     <option>networking.interfaces.*.preferTempAddress</option> was
     <literal>true</literal>, undeclared interfaces would not prefer temporary
     addresses. Now, interfaces not mentioned in the config will prefer
     temporary addresses. EUI64 addresses can still be set as preferred by
     explicitly setting the option to <literal>false</literal> for the
     interface in question.
    </para>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Since Bittorrent Sync was superseded by Resilio Sync in 2016, the
     <literal>bittorrentSync</literal>, <literal>bittorrentSync14</literal>,
     and <literal>bittorrentSync16</literal> packages have been removed in
     favor of <literal>resilio-sync</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The corresponding module, <option>services.btsync</option> has been
     replaced by the <option>services.resilio</option> module.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The httpd service no longer attempts to start the postgresql service. If you have come to depend
     on this behaviour then you can preserve the behavior with the following configuration:
     <literal>systemd.services.httpd.after = [ "postgresql.service" ];</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
     The option <option>services.httpd.extraSubservices</option> has been
     marked as deprecated. You may still use this feature, but it will be
     removed in a future release of NixOS. You are encouraged to convert any
     httpd subservices you may have written to a full NixOS module.
    </para>
    <para>
     Most of the httpd subservices packaged with NixOS have been replaced with
     full NixOS modules including LimeSurvey, WordPress, and Zabbix. These
     modules can be enabled using the <option>services.limesurvey.enable</option>,
     <option>services.wordpress.enable</option>, and <option>services.zabbixWeb.enable</option> options.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The option <option>systemd.network.networks.&lt;name&gt;.routes.*.routeConfig.GatewayOnlink</option>
     was renamed to <option>systemd.network.networks.&lt;name&gt;.routes.*.routeConfig.GatewayOnLink</option>
     (capital <literal>L</literal>). This follows

    <para>
     As of this release the NixOps feature <literal>autoLuks</literal> is deprecated. It no longer works
     with our systemd version without manual intervention.
    </para>
    <para>
     Whenever the usage of the module is detected the evaluation will fail with a message
     explaining why and how to deal with the situation.
    </para>
    <para>
     A new knob named <literal>nixops.enableDeprecatedAutoLuks</literal>
     has been introduced to disable the eval failure and to acknowledge the notice was received and read.
     If you plan on using the feature please note that it might break with subsequent updates.
    </para>
    <para>
     Make sure you set the <literal>_netdev</literal> option for each of the file systems referring to block
     devices provided by the autoLuks module. Not doing this might render the system in a
     state where it doesn't boot anymore.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are actively using the <literal>autoLuks</literal> module please let us know in
     <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/62211">issue #62211</link>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The setopt declarations will be evaluated at the end of <literal>/etc/zshrc</literal>, so any code in <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.interactiveShellInit" />,
     <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.loginShellInit" /> and <xref linkend="opt-programs.zsh.promptInit" /> may break if it relies on those options being set.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <literal>prometheus-nginx-exporter</literal> package now uses the offical exporter provided by NGINX Inc.
      Its metrics are differently structured and are incompatible to the old ones. For information about the metrics,
      have a look at the <link xlink:href="https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-prometheus-exporter">official repo</link>.

     The <option>documentation</option> module gained an option named
     <option>documentation.nixos.includeAllModules</option> which makes the
     generated <citerefentry>
     <refentrytitle>configuration.nix</refentrytitle>
     <manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> manual page include all options
     from all NixOS modules included in a given
     <literal>configuration.nix</literal> configuration file. Currently, it is
     set to <literal>false</literal> by default as enabling it frequently
     prevents evaluation. But the plan is to eventually have it set to
     <literal>true</literal> by default. Please set it to
     <literal>true</literal> now in your <literal>configuration.nix</literal>
     and fix all the bugs it uncovers.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <literal>vlc</literal> package gained support for Chromecast
     streaming, enabled by default. TCP port 8010 must be open for it to work,
     so something like <literal>networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 8010
     ];</literal> may be required in your configuration. Also consider enabling
     <link xlink:href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Accelerated_Video_Playback">
     Accelerated Video Playback</link> for better transcoding performance.

     The <literal>mysql</literal> service now runs as <literal>mysql</literal>
     user. Previously, systemd did execute it as root, and mysql dropped privileges
     itself.
     This includes <literal>ExecStartPre=</literal> and
     <literal>ExecStartPost=</literal> phases.
     To accomplish that, runtime and data directory setup was delegated to
     RuntimeDirectory and tmpfiles.

     With the upgrade to systemd version 242 the <literal>systemd-timesyncd</literal>
     service is no longer using <literal>DynamicUser=yes</literal>. In order for the
     upgrade to work we rely on an activation script to move the state from the old
     to the new directory. The older directory (prior <literal>19.09</literal>) was
     <literal>/var/lib/private/systemd/timesync</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     As long as the <literal>system.config.stateVersion</literal> is below

     The package <literal>avahi</literal> is now built to look up service
     definitions from <literal>/etc/avahi/services</literal> instead of its
     output directory in the nix store. Accordingly the module
     <option>avahi</option> now supports custom service definitions via
     <option>services.avahi.extraServiceFiles</option>, which are then placed
     in the aforementioned directory. See <citerefentry>
     <refentrytitle>avahi.service</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum>

     Since version 0.1.19, <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> honors package
     includes that are specified in the <filename>Cargo.toml</filename>
     file of Rust crates. <literal>rustPlatform.buildRustPackage</literal> uses
     <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> to collect and build dependent crates.
     Since this change in <literal>cargo-vendor</literal> changes the set of
     vendored files for most Rust packages, the hash that use used to verify
     the dependencies, <literal>cargoSha256</literal>, also changes.

    <para>
     The <literal>cargoSha256</literal> hashes of all in-tree derivations that
     use <literal>buildRustPackage</literal> have been updated to reflect this

     The default resample-method for PulseAudio has been changed from the upstream default <literal>speex-float-1</literal>
     to <literal>speex-float-5</literal>. Be aware that low-powered ARM-based and MIPS-based boards will struggle with this
