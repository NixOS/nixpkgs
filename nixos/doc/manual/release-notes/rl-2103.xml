      <para>
        <literal>systemd-journal2gelf</literal> no longer parses json and expects the receiving system to handle it. How to achieve this with Graylog is described in this <link xlink:href="https://github.com/parse-nl/SystemdJournal2Gelf/issues/10">GitHub issue</link>.
      </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If the <varname>services.dbus</varname> module is enabled, then
     the user D-Bus session is now always socket activated. The
     associated options <varname>services.dbus.socketActivated</varname>
     and <varname>services.xserver.startDbusSession</varname> have
     therefore been removed and you will receive a warning if
     they are present in your configuration. This change makes the
     user D-Bus session available also for non-graphical logins.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The option <option>fonts.enableFontDir</option> has been renamed to
     <xref linkend="opt-fonts.fontDir.enable"/>. The path of font directory
     has also been changed to <literal>/run/current-system/sw/share/X11/fonts</literal>,
     for consistency with other X11 resources.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      A number of options have been renamed in the kicad interface. <literal>oceSupport</literal>
      has been renamed to <literal>withOCE</literal>, <literal>withOCCT</literal> has been renamed
      to <literal>withOCC</literal>, <literal>ngspiceSupport</literal> has been renamed to
      <literal>withNgspice</literal>, and <literal>scriptingSupport</literal> has been renamed to
      <literal>withScripting</literal>. Additionally, <literal>kicad/base.nix</literal> no longer
      provides default argument values since these are provided by
      <literal>kicad/default.nix</literal>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      The socket for the <literal>pdns-recursor</literal> module was moved from <literal>/var/lib/pdns-recursor</literal>
      to <literal>/run/pdns-recursor</literal> to match upstream.

     The default-version of <literal>nextcloud</literal> is <package>nextcloud20</package>.
     Please note that it's <emphasis>not</emphasis> possible to upgrade <literal>nextcloud</literal>
     across multiple major versions! This means that it's e.g. not possible to upgrade
     from <package>nextcloud18</package> to <package>nextcloud20</package> in a single deploy.
