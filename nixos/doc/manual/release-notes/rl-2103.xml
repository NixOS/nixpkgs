      <para>
        <literal>systemd-journal2gelf</literal> no longer parses json and expects the receiving system to handle it. How to achieve this with Graylog is described in this <link xlink:href="https://github.com/parse-nl/SystemdJournal2Gelf/issues/10">GitHub issue</link>.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     If the <varname>services.dbus</varname> module is enabled, then
     the user D-Bus session is now always socket activated. The
     associated options <varname>services.dbus.socketActivated</varname>
     and <varname>services.xserver.startDbusSession</varname> have
     therefore been removed and you will receive a warning if
     they are present in your configuration. This change makes the
     user D-Bus session available also for non-graphical logins.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The option <option>fonts.enableFontDir</option> has been renamed to
     <xref linkend="opt-fonts.fontDir.enable"/>. The path of font directory
     has also been changed to <literal>/run/current-system/sw/share/X11/fonts</literal>,
     for consistency with other X11 resources.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      A number of options have been renamed in the kicad interface. <literal>oceSupport</literal>
      has been renamed to <literal>withOCE</literal>, <literal>withOCCT</literal> has been renamed
      to <literal>withOCC</literal>, <literal>ngspiceSupport</literal> has been renamed to
      <literal>withNgspice</literal>, and <literal>scriptingSupport</literal> has been renamed to
      <literal>withScripting</literal>. Additionally, <literal>kicad/base.nix</literal> no longer
      provides default argument values since these are provided by
      <literal>kicad/default.nix</literal>.

      The socket for the <literal>pdns-recursor</literal> module was moved from <literal>/var/lib/pdns-recursor</literal>

      PowerDNS has been updated from <literal>4.2.x</literal> to <literal>4.3.x</literal>. Please
      be sure to review the <link xlink:href="https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/upgrading.html#x-to-4-3-0">Upgrade Notes</link>
      provided by upstream before upgrading. Worth specifically noting is that the service now runs
      entirely as a dedicated <literal>pdns</literal> user, instead of starting as <literal>root</literal>
      and dropping privileges, as well as the default <literal>socket-dir</literal> location changing from
      <literal>/var/lib/powerdns</literal> to <literal>/run/pdns</literal>.

      previously did nothing, but has been fixed. However its default has been

     The default-version of <literal>nextcloud</literal> is <package>nextcloud20</package>.
     Please note that it's <emphasis>not</emphasis> possible to upgrade <literal>nextcloud</literal>
     across multiple major versions! This means that it's e.g. not possible to upgrade
     from <package>nextcloud18</package> to <package>nextcloud20</package> in a single deploy.

     The package can be manually upgraded by setting <xref linkend="opt-services.nextcloud.package" />

     NixOS now emits a deprecation warning if systemd's <literal>StartLimitInterval</literal> setting is used in a <literal>serviceConfig</literal> section instead of in a <literal>unitConfig</literal>; that setting is deprecated and now undocumented for the service section by systemd upstream, but still effective and somewhat buggy there, which can be confusing. See <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/45785">#45785</link> for details.

     All services should use <xref linkend="opt-systemd.services._name_.startLimitIntervalSec" /> or <literal>StartLimitIntervalSec</literal> in <xref linkend="opt-systemd.services._name_.unitConfig" /> instead.

    <para>
     The Unbound DNS resolver service (<literal>services.unbound</literal>) has been refactored to allow reloading, control sockets and to fix startup ordering issues.
    </para>

    <para>
     It is now possible to enable a local UNIX control socket for unbound by setting the <xref linkend="opt-services.unbound.localControlSocketPath" />
     option.
    </para>

    <para>
     Previously we just applied a very minimal set of restrictions and
     trusted unbound to properly drop root privs and capabilities.
    </para>

    <para>
     As of this we are (for the most part) just using the upstream
     example unit file for unbound. The main difference is that we start
     unbound as <literal>unbound</literal> user with the required capabilities instead of
     letting unbound do the chroot &amp; uid/gid changes.
    </para>

    <para>
     The upstream unit configuration this is based on is a lot stricter with
     all kinds of permissions then our previous variant. It also came with
     the default of having the <literal>Type</literal> set to <literal>notify</literal>, therefore we are now also
     using the <literal>unbound-with-systemd</literal> package here. Unbound will start up,
     read the configuration files and start listening on the configured ports
     before systemd will declare the unit <literal>active (running)</literal>.
     This will likely help with startup order and the occasional race condition during system
     activation where the DNS service is started but not yet ready to answer
     queries. Services depending on <literal>nss-lookup.target</literal> or <literal>unbound.service</literal>
     are now be able to use unbound when those targets have been reached.
    </para>

    <para>
     Aditionally to the much stricter runtime environmet the
     <literal>/dev/urandom</literal> mount lines we previously had in the code (that would
     randomly failed during the stop-phase) have been removed as systemd will take care of those for us.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <literal>preStart</literal> script is now only required if we enabled the trust
      anchor updates (which are still enabled by default).
    </para>

    <para>
     Another benefit of the refactoring is that we can now issue reloads via
     either <literal>pkill -HUP unbound</literal> and <literal>systemctl reload unbound</literal> to reload the
     running configuration without taking the daemon offline. A prerequisite
     of this was that unbound configuration is available on a well known path
     on the file system. We are using the path <literal>/etc/unbound/unbound.conf</literal> as that is the
     default in the CLI tooling which in turn enables us to use
     <literal>unbound-control</literal> without passing a custom configuration location.
