<title>Container Networking</title>

<para>When you create a container using <literal>nixos-container
create</literal>, it gets it own private IPv4 address in the range
<literal>10.233.0.0/16</literal>. You can get the container’s IPv4
address as follows:

<screen>
# nixos-container show-ip foo
10.233.4.2

$ ping -c1 10.233.4.2
64 bytes from 10.233.4.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.106 ms
</screen>

</para>

<para>Networking is implemented using a pair of virtual Ethernet
devices. The network interface in the container is called
<literal>eth0</literal>, while the matching interface in the host is
called <literal>ve-<replaceable>container-name</replaceable></literal>
(e.g., <literal>ve-foo</literal>).  The container has its own network
namespace and the <literal>CAP_NET_ADMIN</literal> capability, so it
can perform arbitrary network configuration such as setting up
firewall rules, without affecting or having access to the host’s
network.</para>

<para>By default, containers cannot talk to the outside network. If
you want that, you should set up Network Address Translation (NAT)
rules on the host to rewrite container traffic to use your external
IP address. This can be accomplished using the following configuration
on the host:

<programlisting>
networking.nat.enable = true;
networking.nat.internalInterfaces = ["ve-+"];
networking.nat.externalInterface = "eth0";
</programlisting>
where <literal>eth0</literal> should be replaced with the desired
external interface. Note that <literal>ve-+</literal> is a wildcard
that matches all container interfaces.</para>
