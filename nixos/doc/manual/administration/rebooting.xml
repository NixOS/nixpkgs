<title>Rebooting and Shutting Down</title>

<para>The system can be shut down (and automatically powered off) by
doing:

<screen>
# shutdown
</screen>

This is equivalent to running <command>systemctl
poweroff</command>.</para>

<para>To reboot the system, run

<screen>
# reboot
</screen>

which is equivalent to <command>systemctl reboot</command>.
Alternatively, you can quickly reboot the system using
<literal>kexec</literal>, which bypasses the BIOS by directly loading
the new kernel into memory:

<screen>
# systemctl kexec
</screen>

</para>

<para>The machine can be suspended to RAM (if supported) using
<command>systemctl suspend</command>, and suspended to disk using
<command>systemctl hibernate</command>.</para>

<para>These commands can be run by any user who is logged in locally,
i.e. on a virtual console or in X11; otherwise, the user is asked for
authentication.</para>
