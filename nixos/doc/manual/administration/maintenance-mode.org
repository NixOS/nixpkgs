* Maintenance Mode
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-maintenance-mode
  :END:

You can enter rescue mode by running:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # systemctl rescue
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will eventually give you a single-user root shell. Systemd will
stop (almost) all system services. To get out of maintenance mode, just
exit from the rescue shell.
