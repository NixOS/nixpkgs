* Rebooting and Shutting Down
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-rebooting
  :END:

The system can be shut down (and automatically powered off) by doing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # shutdown
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is equivalent to running =systemctl poweroff=.

To reboot the system, run

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # reboot
#+END_EXAMPLE

which is equivalent to =systemctl reboot=. Alternatively, you can
quickly reboot the system using =kexec=, which bypasses the BIOS by
directly loading the new kernel into memory:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # systemctl kexec
#+END_EXAMPLE

The machine can be suspended to RAM (if supported) using =systemctl
  suspend=, and suspended to disk using =systemctl
  hibernate=.

These commands can be run by any user who is logged in locally, i.e. on
a virtual console or in X11; otherwise, the user is asked for
authentication.
