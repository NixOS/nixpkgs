Nix uses a so-called /binary cache/ to optimise building a package from
source into downloading it as a pre-built binary. That is, whenever a
command like =nixos-rebuild= needs a path in the Nix store, Nix will try
to download that path from the Internet rather than build it from
source. The default binary cache is [[https://cache.nixos.org/]]. If
this cache is unreachable, Nix operations may take a long time due to
HTTP connection timeouts. You can disable the use of the binary cache by
adding =--option
  use-binary-caches false=, e.g.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # nixos-rebuild switch --option use-binary-caches false
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you have an alternative binary cache at your disposal, you can use it
instead:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # nixos-rebuild switch --option binary-caches http://my-cache.example.org/
#+END_EXAMPLE
