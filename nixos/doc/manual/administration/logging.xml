 <title>Logging</title>
 <para>
  System-wide logging is provided by systemd’s <emphasis>journal</emphasis>,
  which subsumes traditional logging daemons such as syslogd and klogd. Log
  entries are kept in binary files in <filename>/var/log/journal/</filename>.
  The command <literal>journalctl</literal> allows you to see the contents of
  the journal. For example,
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt>journalctl -b
</screen>
  shows all journal entries since the last reboot. (The output of
  <command>journalctl</command> is piped into <command>less</command> by
  default.) You can use various options and match operators to restrict output
  to messages of interest. For instance, to get all messages from PostgreSQL:
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt>journalctl -u postgresql.service
-- Logs begin at Mon, 2013-01-07 13:28:01 CET, end at Tue, 2013-01-08 01:09:57 CET. --
...

-- Reboot --
Jan 07 15:45:10 hagbard postgres[2532]: [1-1] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2013-01-07 15:44:14 CET
Jan 07 15:45:13 hagbard postgres[2500]: [1-1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
</screen>
  Or to get all messages since the last reboot that have at least a
  “critical” severity level:
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt>journalctl -b -p crit

</screen>
 </para>
 <para>
  The system journal is readable by root and by users in the
  <literal>wheel</literal> and <literal>systemd-journal</literal> groups. All
  users have a private journal that can be read using
  <command>journalctl</command>.
