* Declarative Package Management
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-declarative-package-mgmt
  :END:

With declarative package management, you specify which packages you want
on your system by setting the option
[[#opt-environment.systemPackages][???]]. For instance, adding the
following line to =configuration.nix= enables the Mozilla Thunderbird
email application:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   = [ pkgs.thunderbird ];
#+END_EXAMPLE

The effect of this specification is that the Thunderbird package from
Nixpkgs will be built or downloaded as part of the system when you run
=nixos-rebuild switch=.

You can get a list of the available packages as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ nix-env -qaP '*' --description
  nixos.firefox   firefox-23.0   Mozilla Firefox - the browser, reloaded
  ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first column in the output is the /attribute name/, such as
=nixos.thunderbird=.

Note: the =nixos= prefix tells us that we want to get the package from
the =nixos= channel and works only in CLI tools. In declarative
configuration use =pkgs= prefix (variable).

To “uninstall” a package, simply remove it from
[[#opt-environment.systemPackages][???]] and run =nixos-rebuild switch=.
