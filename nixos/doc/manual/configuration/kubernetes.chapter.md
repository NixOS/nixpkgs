# Kubernetes {#sec-kubernetes}

The NixOS Kubernetes module is a collective term for a handful of
individual submodules implementing the Kubernetes cluster components.

There are generally two ways of enabling Kubernetes on NixOS. One way is
to enable and configure cluster components appropriately by hand:

```nix
services.kubernetes = {
  apiserver.enable = true;
  controllerManager.enable = true;
  scheduler.enable = true;
  addonManager.enable = true;
  proxy.enable = true;
  flannel.enable = true;
};
```

Another way is to assign cluster roles (\"master\" and/or \"node\") to
the host. This enables apiserver, controllerManager, scheduler,
addonManager, kube-proxy and etcd:

```nix
services.kubernetes.roles = [ "master" ];
```

While this will enable the kubelet and kube-proxy only:

```nix
services.kubernetes.roles = [ "node" ];
```

Assigning both the master and node roles is usable if you want a single
node Kubernetes cluster for dev or testing purposes:

```nix
services.kubernetes.roles = [ "master" "node" ];
```

Note: Assigning either role will also default both
[](#opt-services.kubernetes.flannel.enable)
and [](#opt-services.kubernetes.easyCerts)
to true. This sets up flannel as CNI and activates automatic PKI bootstrapping.

As of kubernetes 1.10.X it has been deprecated to open non-tls-enabled
ports on kubernetes components. Thus, from NixOS 19.03 all plain HTTP
ports have been disabled by default. While opening insecure ports is
still possible, it is recommended not to bind these to other interfaces
than loopback. To re-enable the insecure port on the apiserver, see options:
[](#opt-services.kubernetes.apiserver.insecurePort) and
[](#opt-services.kubernetes.apiserver.insecureBindAddress)

::: {.note}
As of NixOS 19.03, it is mandatory to configure:
[](#opt-services.kubernetes.masterAddress).
The masterAddress must be resolveable and routeable by all cluster nodes.
In single node clusters, this can be set to `localhost`.
:::

Role-based access control (RBAC) authorization mode is enabled by
default. This means that anonymous requests to the apiserver secure port
will expectedly cause a permission denied error. All cluster components
must therefore be configured with x509 certificates for two-way tls
communication. The x509 certificate subject section determines the roles
and permissions granted by the apiserver to perform clusterwide or
namespaced operations. See also: [ Using RBAC
Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

The NixOS kubernetes module provides an option for automatic certificate
bootstrapping and configuration,
[](#opt-services.kubernetes.easyCerts).
The PKI bootstrapping process involves setting up a certificate authority (CA)
daemon (cfssl) on the kubernetes master node. cfssl generates a CA-cert
for the cluster, and uses the CA-cert for signing subordinate certs issued
to each of the cluster components. Subsequently, the certmgr daemon monitors
active certificates and renews them when needed. For single node Kubernetes
clusters, setting [](#opt-services.kubernetes.easyCerts)
= true is sufficient and no further action is required. For joining extra node
machines to an existing cluster on the other hand, establishing initial
trust is mandatory.

To add new nodes to the cluster: On any (non-master) cluster node where
[](#opt-services.kubernetes.easyCerts)
is enabled, the helper script `nixos-kubernetes-node-join` is available on PATH.
Given a token on stdin, it will copy the token to the kubernetes secrets directory
and restart the certmgr service. As requested certificates are issued, the
script will restart kubernetes cluster components as needed for them to
pick up new keypairs.

::: {.note}
Multi-master (HA) clusters are not supported by the easyCerts module.
:::

In order to interact with an RBAC-enabled cluster as an administrator,
one needs to have cluster-admin privileges. By default, when easyCerts
is enabled, a cluster-admin kubeconfig file is generated and linked into
`/etc/kubernetes/cluster-admin.kubeconfig` as determined by
[](#opt-services.kubernetes.pki.etcClusterAdminKubeconfig).
`export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/cluster-admin.kubeconfig` will make
kubectl use this kubeconfig to access and authenticate the cluster. The
cluster-admin kubeconfig references an auto-generated keypair owned by
root. Thus, only root on the kubernetes master may obtain cluster-admin
rights by means of this file.
