* IPv4 Configuration
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-ipv4
  :END:

By default, NixOS uses DHCP (specifically, =dhcpcd=) to automatically
configure network interfaces. However, you can configure an interface
manually as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  networking.interfaces.eth0.ipv4.addresses = [ {
    address = "192.168.1.2";
    prefixLength = 24;
  } ];
#+END_EXAMPLE

Typically you'll also want to set a default gateway and set of name
servers:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   = "192.168.1.1";
   = [ "8.8.8.8" ];
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Note*

  Statically configured interfaces are set up by the systemd service
  interface-name=-cfg.service=. The default gateway and name server
  configuration is performed by =network-setup.service=.
#+END_QUOTE

The host name is set using [[#opt-networking.hostName][???]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   = "cartman";
#+END_EXAMPLE

The default host name is =nixos=. Set it to the empty string (=""=) to
allow the DHCP server to provide the host name.
