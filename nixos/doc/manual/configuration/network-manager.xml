<title>NetworkManager</title>

<para>To facilitate network configuration, some desktop environments
use NetworkManager. You can enable NetworkManager by setting:

<programlisting>
networking.networkmanager.enable = true;
</programlisting>

some desktop managers (e.g., GNOME) enable NetworkManager
automatically for you.</para>

<para>All users that should have permission to change network settings must
belong to the <code>networkmanager</code> group:

<programlisting>
users.extraUsers.youruser.extraGroups = [ "networkmanager" ];
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>NetworkManager is controlled using either <command>nmcli</command> or
<command>nmtui</command> (curses-based terminal user interface). See their
manual pages for details on their usage. Some desktop environments (GNOME, KDE)
have their own configuration tools for NetworkManager.</para>

<note><para><code>networking.networkmanager</code> and
<code>networking.wireless</code> (WPA Supplicant) cannot be enabled at the same
time: you can still connect to the wireless networks using
NetworkManager.</para></note>
