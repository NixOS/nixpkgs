# User Management {#sec-user-management}

NixOS supports both declarative and imperative styles of user
management. In the declarative style, users are specified in
`configuration.nix`. For instance, the following states that a user
account named `alice` shall exist:

```nix
users.users.alice = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  home = "/home/alice";
  description = "Alice Foobar";
  extraGroups = [ "wheel" "networkmanager" ];
  openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [ "ssh-dss AAAAB3Nza... alice@foobar" ];
};
```

Note that `alice` is a member of the `wheel` and `networkmanager`
groups, which allows her to use `sudo` to execute commands as `root` and
to configure the network, respectively. Also note the SSH public key
that allows remote logins with the corresponding private key. Users
created in this way do not have a password by default, so they cannot
log in via mechanisms that require a password. However, you can use the
`passwd` program to set a password, which is retained across invocations
of `nixos-rebuild`.

If you set [](#opt-users.mutableUsers) to
false, then the contents of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` will be congruent
to your NixOS configuration. For instance, if you remove a user from
[](#opt-users.users) and run nixos-rebuild, the user
account will cease to exist. Also, imperative commands for managing users and
groups, such as useradd, are no longer available. Passwords may still be
assigned by setting the user\'s
[hashedPassword](#opt-users.users._name_.hashedPassword) option. A
hashed password can be generated using `mkpasswd -m
  sha-512`.

A user ID (uid) is assigned automatically. You can also specify a uid
manually by adding

```nix
uid = 1000;
```

to the user specification.

Groups can be specified similarly. The following states that a group
named `students` shall exist:

```nix
users.groups.students.gid = 1000;
```

As with users, the group ID (gid) is optional and will be assigned
automatically if it's missing.

In the imperative style, users and groups are managed by commands such
as `useradd`, `groupmod` and so on. For instance, to create a user
account named `alice`:

```ShellSession
# useradd -m alice
```

To make all nix tools available to this new user use \`su - USER\` which
opens a login shell (==shell that loads the profile) for given user.
This will create the \~/.nix-defexpr symlink. So run:

```ShellSession
# su - alice -c "true"
```

The flag `-m` causes the creation of a home directory for the new user,
which is generally what you want. The user does not have an initial
password and therefore cannot log in. A password can be set using the
`passwd` utility:

```ShellSession
# passwd alice
Enter new UNIX password: ***
Retype new UNIX password: ***
```

A user can be deleted using `userdel`:

```ShellSession
# userdel -r alice
```

The flag `-r` deletes the user's home directory. Accounts can be
modified using `usermod`. Unix groups can be managed using `groupadd`,
`groupmod` and `groupdel`.
