* Hardened
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-profile-hardened
  :END:

A profile with most (vanilla) hardening options enabled by default,
potentially at the cost of features and performance.

This includes a hardened kernel, and limiting the system information
available to processes through the =/sys= and =/proc= filesystems. It
also disables the User Namespaces feature of the kernel, which stops Nix
from being able to build anything (this particular setting can be
overriden via [[#opt-security.allowUserNamespaces][???]]). See the =
  profile source= for further detail on which settings are altered.
