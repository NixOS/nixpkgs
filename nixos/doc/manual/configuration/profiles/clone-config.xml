 <title>Clone Config</title>

 <para>
  This profile is used in installer images. It provides an editable
  configuration.nix that imports all the modules that were also used when
  creating the image in the first place. As a result it allows users to edit
  and rebuild the live-system.
 </para>

 <para>
  On images where the installation media also becomes an installation target,
  copying over <literal>configuration.nix</literal> should be disabled by
  setting <literal>installer.cloneConfig</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.
  For example, this is done in <literal>sd-image-aarch64.nix</literal>.
