* Profiles

In some cases, it may be desirable to take advantage of commonly-used,
predefined configurations provided by nixpkgs, but different from those
that come as default. This is a role fulfilled by NixOS's Profiles,
which come as files living in =<nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles>=. That
is to say, expected usage is to add them to the imports list of your
=/etc/configuration.nix= as such:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    imports = [
     <nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles/profile-name.nix>
    ];
#+END_EXAMPLE

Even if some of these profiles seem only useful in the context of
install media, many are actually intended to be used in real installs.

What follows is a brief explanation on the purpose and use-case for each
profile. Detailing each option configured by each one is out of scope.
