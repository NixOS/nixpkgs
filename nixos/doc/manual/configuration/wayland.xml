  While X11 (see <xref linkend="sec-x11"/>) is still the primary display
  technology on NixOS, Wayland support is steadily improving.
  Where X11 separates the X Server and the window manager, on Wayland those
  are combined: a Wayland Compositor is like an X11 window manager, but also
  embeds the Wayland 'Server' functionality. This means it is sufficient to
  install a Wayland Compositor such as <package>sway</package> without
  separately enabling a Wayland server:
<programlisting>
<xref linkend="opt-programs.sway.enable"/> = true;
</programlisting>
  This installs the <package>sway</package> compositor along with some
  essential utilities. Now you can start <package>sway</package> from the TTY
  console.
