<title>Obtaining NixOS</title>

<para>NixOS ISO images can be downloaded from the <link
xlink:href="http://nixos.org/nixos/download.html">NixOS
homepage</link>.  There are a number of installation options.  If
you happen to have an optical drive and a spare CD, burning the
image to CD and booting from that is probably the easiest option.
Most people will need to prepare a USB stick to boot from.
Unetbootin is recommended and the process is described in brief below.
Note that systems which use UEFI require some additional manual steps.
If you run into difficulty a number of alternative methods are presented
in the <link

Wiki</link>.</para>
