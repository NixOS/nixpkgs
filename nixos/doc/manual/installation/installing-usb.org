* Booting from a USB Drive

For systems without CD drive, the NixOS live CD can be booted from a USB
stick. You can use the =dd= utility to write the image:
=dd if=path-to-image
  of=/dev/sdX=. Be careful about specifying the correct drive; you can
use the =lsblk= command to get a list of block devices.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ diskutil list
    [..]
    /dev/diskN (external, physical):
       #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
    [..]
    $ diskutil unmountDisk diskN
    Unmount of all volumes on diskN was successful
    $ sudo dd if=nix.iso of=/dev/rdiskN
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Using the 'raw' =rdiskN= device instead of =diskN= completes in
  minutes instead of hours. After =dd= completes, a GUI dialog "The disk
  you inserted was not readable by this computer" will pop up, which can
  be ignored.

The =dd= utility will write the image verbatim to the drive, making it
the recommended option for both UEFI and non-UEFI installations.
