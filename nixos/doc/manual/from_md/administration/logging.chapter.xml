  <title>Logging</title>
  <para>
    System-wide logging is provided by systemdâ€™s
    <emphasis>journal</emphasis>, which subsumes traditional logging
    daemons such as syslogd and klogd. Log entries are kept in binary
    files in <literal>/var/log/journal/</literal>. The command
    <literal>journalctl</literal> allows you to see the contents of the
    journal. For example,
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ journalctl -b
</programlisting>
  <para>
    shows all journal entries since the last reboot. (The output of
    <literal>journalctl</literal> is piped into <literal>less</literal>
    by default.) You can use various options and match operators to
    restrict output to messages of interest. For instance, to get all
    messages from PostgreSQL:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ journalctl -u postgresql.service
-- Logs begin at Mon, 2013-01-07 13:28:01 CET, end at Tue, 2013-01-08 01:09:57 CET. --
...
Jan 07 15:44:14 hagbard postgres[2681]: [2-1] LOG:  database system is shut down
-- Reboot --
Jan 07 15:45:10 hagbard postgres[2532]: [1-1] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2013-01-07 15:44:14 CET
Jan 07 15:45:13 hagbard postgres[2500]: [1-1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Or to get all messages since the last reboot that have at least a
    <quote>critical</quote> severity level:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ journalctl -b -p crit
Dec 17 21:08:06 mandark sudo[3673]: pam_unix(sudo:auth): auth could not identify password for [alice]
Dec 29 01:30:22 mandark kernel[6131]: [1053513.909444] CPU6: Core temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 1)
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The system journal is readable by root and by users in the
    <literal>wheel</literal> and <literal>systemd-journal</literal>
    groups. All users have a private journal that can be read using
    <literal>journalctl</literal>.
  </para>
