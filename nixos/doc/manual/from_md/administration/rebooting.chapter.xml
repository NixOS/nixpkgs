  <title>Rebooting and Shutting Down</title>
  <para>
    The system can be shut down (and automatically powered off) by
    doing:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
# shutdown
</programlisting>
  <para>
    This is equivalent to running <literal>systemctl poweroff</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
    To reboot the system, run
  </para>
  <programlisting>
# reboot
</programlisting>
  <para>
    which is equivalent to <literal>systemctl reboot</literal>.
    Alternatively, you can quickly reboot the system using
    <literal>kexec</literal>, which bypasses the BIOS by directly
    loading the new kernel into memory:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
# systemctl kexec
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The machine can be suspended to RAM (if supported) using
    <literal>systemctl suspend</literal>, and suspended to disk using
    <literal>systemctl hibernate</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
    These commands can be run by any user who is logged in locally, i.e.
    on a virtual console or in X11; otherwise, the user is asked for
    authentication.
  </para>
