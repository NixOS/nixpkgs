  <title>Maintenance Mode</title>
  <para>
    You can enter rescue mode by running:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
# systemctl rescue
</programlisting>
  <para>
    This will eventually give you a single-user root shell. Systemd will
    stop (almost) all system services. To get out of maintenance mode,
    just exit from the rescue shell.
