    While X11 (see <xref linkend="sec-x11" />) is still the primary
    display technology on NixOS, Wayland support is steadily improving.
    Where X11 separates the X Server and the window manager, on Wayland
    those are combined: a Wayland Compositor is like an X11 window
    manager, but also embeds the Wayland 'Server' functionality. This
    means it is sufficient to install a Wayland Compositor such as sway
    without separately enabling a Wayland server:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="bash">
programs.sway.enable = true;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    This installs the sway compositor along with some essential
    utilities. Now you can start sway from the TTY console.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you are using a wlroots-based compositor, like sway, and want to
    be able to share your screen, you might want to activate this
    option:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="bash">
xdg.portal.wlr.enable = true;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    and configure Pipewire using
    <xref linkend="opt-services.pipewire.enable" /> and related options.
  </para>
