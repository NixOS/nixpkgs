  <title>Profiles</title>
  <para>
    In some cases, it may be desirable to take advantage of
    commonly-used, predefined configurations provided by nixpkgs, but
    different from those that come as default. This is a role fulfilled
    by NixOS's Profiles, which come as files living in
    <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles&gt;</literal>. That is
    to say, expected usage is to add them to the imports list of your
    <literal>/etc/configuration.nix</literal> as such:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="bash">
imports = [
  &lt;nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles/profile-name.nix&gt;
];
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Even if some of these profiles seem only useful in the context of
    install media, many are actually intended to be used in real
    installs.
  </para>
  <para>
    What follows is a brief explanation on the purpose and use-case for
    each profile. Detailing each option configured by each one is out of
    scope.
