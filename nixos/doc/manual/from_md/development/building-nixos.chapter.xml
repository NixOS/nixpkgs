  <title>Building Your Own NixOS CD</title>
  <para>
    Building a NixOS CD is as easy as configuring your own computer. The
    idea is to use another module which will replace your
    <literal>configuration.nix</literal> to configure the system that
    would be installed on the CD.
  </para>
  <para>
    Default CD/DVD configurations are available inside
    <literal>nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd</literal>
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git
$ cd nixpkgs/nixos
$ nix-build -A config.system.build.isoImage -I nixos-config=modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix default.nix
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Before burning your CD/DVD, you can check the content of the image
    by mounting anywhere like suggested by the following command:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
# mount -o loop -t iso9660 ./result/iso/cd.iso /mnt/iso&lt;/screen&gt;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    If you want to customize your NixOS CD in more detail, or generate
    other kinds of images, you might want to check out

    This can also be a good starting point when you want to use Nix to
    build a <quote>minimal</quote> image that doesnâ€™t include a NixOS
    installation.
