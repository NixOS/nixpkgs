          During cross-compilation, tests are now executed if the test
          suite can be executed by the build platform. This is the case
          when doing “native” cross-compilation where the build and host
          platforms are largely the same, but the nixpkgs’ cross
          compilation infrastructure is used, e.g.
          <literal>pkgsStatic</literal> and <literal>pkgsLLVM</literal>.
          Another possibility is that the build platform is a superset
          of the host platform, e.g. when cross-compiling from
          <literal>x86_64-unknown-linux</literal> to
          <literal>i686-unknown-linux</literal>. The predicate gating
          test suite execution is the newly added
          <literal>canExecute</literal> predicate: You can e.g. check if
          <literal>stdenv.buildPlatform</literal> can execute binaries
          built for <literal>stdenv.hostPlatform</literal> (i.e.
          produced by <literal>stdenv.cc</literal>) by evaluating
          <literal>stdenv.buildPlatform.canExecute stdenv.hostPlatform</literal>.

          The <literal>isCompatible</literal> predicate checking CPU
          compatibility is no longer exposed by the platform sets
          generated using <literal>lib.systems.elaborate</literal>. In
          most cases you will want to use the new
          <literal>canExecute</literal> predicate instead which also
          considers the kernel / syscall interface. It is briefly
          described in the release’s
          <link linkend="sec-release-22.11-highlights">highlights
          section</link>.
          <literal>lib.systems.parse.isCompatible</literal> still
          exists, but has changed semantically: Architectures with
          differing endianness modes are <emphasis>no longer considered
          compatible</emphasis>.

          <literal>ngrok</literal> has been upgraded from 2.3.40 to

          <link xlink:href="https://ngrok.com/docs/ngrok-agent/changelog">changelog</link>.
          Notably, breaking changes are that the config file format has
          changed and support for single hypen arguments was dropped.

          The <literal>isPowerPC</literal> predicate, found on

          (<literal>hostPlatform</literal>,
          <literal>buildPlatform</literal>,
          <literal>targetPlatform</literal>, etc) has been removed in
          order to reduce confusion. The predicate was was defined such
          that it matches only the 32-bit big-endian members of the
          POWER/PowerPC family, despite having a name which would imply
          a broader set of systems. If you were using this predicate,
          you can replace <literal>foo.isPowerPC</literal> with
          <literal>(with foo; isPower &amp;&amp; is32bit &amp;&amp; isBigEndian)</literal>.

          Matrix Synapse now requires entries in the
          <literal>state_group_edges</literal> table to be unique, in
          order to prevent accidentally introducing duplicate
          information (for example, because a database backup was
          restored multiple times). If your Synapse database already has
          duplicate rows in this table, this could fail with an error
          and require manual remediation.

          as coreboot’s fork is no longer available.
