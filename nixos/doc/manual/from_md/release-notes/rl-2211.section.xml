          During cross-compilation, tests are now executed if the test
          suite can be executed by the build platform. This is the case
          when doing “native” cross-compilation where the build and host
          platforms are largely the same, but the nixpkgs’ cross
          compilation infrastructure is used, e.g.
          <literal>pkgsStatic</literal> and <literal>pkgsLLVM</literal>.
          Another possibility is that the build platform is a superset
          of the host platform, e.g. when cross-compiling from
          <literal>x86_64-unknown-linux</literal> to
          <literal>i686-unknown-linux</literal>. The predicate gating
          test suite execution is the newly added
          <literal>canExecute</literal> predicate: You can e.g. check if
          <literal>stdenv.buildPlatform</literal> can execute binaries
          built for <literal>stdenv.hostPlatform</literal> (i.e.
          produced by <literal>stdenv.cc</literal>) by evaluating
          <literal>stdenv.buildPlatform.canExecute stdenv.hostPlatform</literal>.

          The <literal>isCompatible</literal> predicate checking CPU
          compatibility is no longer exposed by the platform sets
          generated using <literal>lib.systems.elaborate</literal>. In
          most cases you will want to use the new
          <literal>canExecute</literal> predicate instead which also
          considers the kernel / syscall interface. It is briefly
          described in the release’s
          <link linkend="sec-release-22.11-highlights">highlights
          section</link>.
          <literal>lib.systems.parse.isCompatible</literal> still
          exists, but has changed semantically: Architectures with
          differing endianness modes are <emphasis>no longer considered
          compatible</emphasis>.

          The <literal>isPowerPC</literal> predicate, found on
          <literal>platform</literal> attrsets
          (<literal>hostPlatform</literal>,
          <literal>buildPlatform</literal>,
          <literal>targetPlatform</literal>, etc) has been removed in
          order to reduce confusion. The predicate was was defined such
          that it matches only the 32-bit big-endian members of the
          POWER/PowerPC family, despite having a name which would imply
          a broader set of systems. If you were using this predicate,
          you can replace <literal>foo.isPowerPC</literal> with
          <literal>(with foo; isPower &amp;&amp; is32bit &amp;&amp; isBigEndian)</literal>.
