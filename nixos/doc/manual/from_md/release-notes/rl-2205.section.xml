        <para>
          <literal>pkgs.ghc</literal> now refers to
          <literal>pkgs.targetPackages.haskellPackages.ghc</literal>.
          This <emphasis>only</emphasis> makes a difference if you are
          cross-compiling and will ensure that
          <literal>pkgs.ghc</literal> always runs on the host platform
          and compiles for the target platform (similar to
          <literal>pkgs.gcc</literal> for example).
          <literal>haskellPackages.ghc</literal> still behaves as
          before, running on the build platform and compiling for the
          host platform (similar to <literal>stdenv.cc</literal>). This
          means you don’t have to adjust your derivations if you use
          <literal>haskellPackages.callPackage</literal>, but when using
          <literal>pkgs.callPackage</literal> and taking
          <literal>ghc</literal> as an input, you should now use
          <literal>buildPackages.ghc</literal> instead to ensure cross
          compilation keeps working (or switch to
          <literal>haskellPackages.callPackage</literal>).

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>pkgs.emacsPackages.orgPackages</literal> is removed
          because org elpa is deprecated. The packages in the top level
          of <literal>pkgs.emacsPackages</literal>, such as org and
          org-contrib, refer to the ones in
          <literal>pkgs.emacsPackages.elpaPackages</literal> and
          <literal>pkgs.emacsPackages.nongnuPackages</literal> where the
          new versions will release.

        <para>
          The <literal>wafHook</literal> hook now honors
          <literal>NIX_BUILD_CORES</literal> when
          <literal>enableParallelBuilding</literal> is not set
          explicitly. Packages can restore the old behaviour by setting
          <literal>enableParallelBuilding=false</literal>.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>pkgs.claws-mail-gtk2</literal>, representing Claws
          Mail’s older release version three, was removed in order to
          get rid of Python 2. Please switch to
          <literal>claws-mail</literal>, which is Claws Mail’s latest
          release based on GTK+3 and Python 3.

          The option
          <link linkend="opt-services.redis.servers">services.redis.servers</link>
          was added to support per-application
          <literal>redis-server</literal> which is more secure since
          Redis databases are only mere key prefixes without any
          configuration or ACL of their own. Backward-compatibility is
          preserved by mapping old
          <literal>services.redis.settings</literal> to
          <literal>services.redis.servers.&quot;&quot;.settings</literal>,
          but you are strongly encouraged to name each
          <literal>redis-server</literal> instance after the application
          using it, instead of keeping that nameless one. Except for the
          nameless
          <literal>services.redis.servers.&quot;&quot;</literal> still
          accessible at <literal>127.0.0.1:6379</literal>, and to the
          members of the Unix group <literal>redis</literal> through the
          Unix socket <literal>/run/redis/redis.sock</literal>, all
          other <literal>services.redis.servers.${serverName}</literal>
          are only accessible by default to the members of the Unix
          group <literal>redis-${serverName}</literal> through the Unix
          socket <literal>/run/redis-${serverName}/redis.sock</literal>.
