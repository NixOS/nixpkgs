          currently is not officially supported for use with the zfs
          filesystem. If you use zfs, you should use a different kernel
          version (either the LTS kernel, or track a specific one).

          <literal>rubyMinimal</literal> was removed due to being unused
          and unusable. The default ruby interpreter includes JIT
          support, which makes it reference it’s compiler. Since JIT
          support is probably needed by some Gems, it was decided to
          enable this feature with all cc references by default, and
          allow to build a Ruby derivation without references to cc, by
          setting <literal>jitSupport = false;</literal> in an overlay.

          specifically noting is that the service now runs entirely as a

          <literal>root</literal> and dropping privileges, as well as

          xfsprogs was update from 4.19 to 5.11. It now enables reflink
          support by default on filesystem creation. Support for
          reflinks was added with an experimental status to kernel 4.9
          and deemed stable in kernel 4.16. If you want to be able to
          mount XFS filesystems created with this release of xfsprogs on
          kernel releases older than those, you need to format them with
          <literal>mkfs.xfs -m reflink=0</literal>.

          The uWSGI server is now built with POSIX capabilities. As a
          consequence, root is no longer required in emperor mode and
          the service defaults to running as the unprivileged
          <literal>uwsgi</literal> user. Any additional capability can
          be added via the new option
          <link xlink:href="options.html#opt-services.uwsgi.capabilities">services.uwsgi.capabilities</link>.
          The previous behaviour can be restored by setting:

          The prometheus json exporter is now managed by the prometheus

          this URL to be passed as an URL parameter, when scraping the

          The <literal>mediatomb</literal> service declares new options.
          It also adapts existing options so the configuration
          generation is now lazy. The existing option
          <literal>customCfg</literal> (defaults to false), when
          enabled, stops the service configuration generation
          completely. It then expects the users to provide their own
          correct configuration at the right location (whereas the
          configuration was generated and not used at all before). The
          new option <literal>transcodingOption</literal> (defaults to
          no) allows a generated configuration. It makes the mediatomb
          service pulls the necessary runtime dependencies in the nix
          store (whereas it was generated with hardcoded values before).
          The new option <literal>mediaDirectories</literal> allows the
          users to declare autoscan media directories from their nixos
          configuration:

          The Unbound DNS resolver service
          (<literal>services.unbound</literal>) has been refactored to
          allow reloading, control sockets and to fix startup ordering
          issues.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is now possible to enable a local UNIX control socket for
          unbound by setting the
          <link xlink:href="options.html#opt-services.unbound.localControlSocketPath">services.unbound.localControlSocketPath</link>
          option.
        </para>
        <para>
          Previously we just applied a very minimal set of restrictions
          and trusted unbound to properly drop root privs and
          capabilities.
        </para>
        <para>
          As of this we are (for the most part) just using the upstream
          example unit file for unbound. The main difference is that we
          start unbound as <literal>unbound</literal> user with the
          required capabilities instead of letting unbound do the chroot
          &amp; uid/gid changes.
        </para>
        <para>
          The upstream unit configuration this is based on is a lot
          stricter with all kinds of permissions then our previous
          variant. It also came with the default of having the
          <literal>Type</literal> set to <literal>notify</literal>,
          therefore we are now also using the
          <literal>unbound-with-systemd</literal> package here. Unbound
          will start up, read the configuration files and start
          listening on the configured ports before systemd will declare
          the unit <literal>active (running)</literal>. This will likely
          help with startup order and the occasional race condition
          during system activation where the DNS service is started but
          not yet ready to answer queries. Services depending on
          <literal>nss-lookup.target</literal> or
          <literal>unbound.service</literal> are now be able to use
          unbound when those targets have been reached.
        </para>
        <para>
          Additionally to the much stricter runtime environment the
          <literal>/dev/urandom</literal> mount lines we previously had
          in the code (that randomly failed during the stop-phase) have
          been removed as systemd will take care of those for us.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <literal>preStart</literal> script is now only required if
          we enabled the trust anchor updates (which are still enabled
          by default).
        </para>
        <para>
          Another benefit of the refactoring is that we can now issue
          reloads via either <literal>pkill -HUP unbound</literal> and
          <literal>systemctl reload unbound</literal> to reload the
          running configuration without taking the daemon offline. A
          prerequisite of this was that unbound configuration is
          available on a well known path on the file system. We are
          using the path <literal>/etc/unbound/unbound.conf</literal> as
          that is the default in the CLI tooling which in turn enables
          us to use <literal>unbound-control</literal> without passing a
          custom configuration location.

          When defining a new user, one of

          users. Note that users defined with an explicit UID below 500

          Mandatory Access Control system, has been substantialy
          improved along with related tools, so that module maintainers
          can now more easily write AppArmor profiles for NixOS. The

          <link xlink:href="options.html#opt-security.apparmor.policies">security.apparmor.policies</link>,
          replacing the previous <literal>profiles</literal> option to

          at the cost of having some of their processes killed when

          For that to work, the gvfs nixos service is enabled by

          lighter version of GVfs (without support for samba). To avoid
          conflicts with other desktop environments this setting has
