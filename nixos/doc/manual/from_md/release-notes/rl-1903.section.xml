          Added the Pantheon desktop environment. It can be enabled
          through
          <literal>services.xserver.desktopManager.pantheon.enable</literal>.
        </para>
        <note>
          <para>
            By default,
            <literal>services.xserver.desktopManager.pantheon</literal>
            enables LightDM as a display manager, as pantheon’s screen
            locking implementation relies on it. Because of that it is
            recommended to leave LightDM enabled. If you’d like to
            disable it anyway, set
            <literal>services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.enable</literal>
            to <literal>false</literal> and enable your preferred
            display manager.
          </para>
        </note>
        <para>
          Also note that Pantheon’s LightDM greeter is not enabled by
          default, because it has numerous issues in NixOS and isn’t
          optimal for use here yet.

          A major refactoring of the Kubernetes module has been
          completed. Refactorings primarily focus on decoupling
          components and enhancing security. Two-way TLS and RBAC has
          been enabled by default for all components, which slightly
          changes the way the module is configured. See:
          <xref linkend="sec-kubernetes" /> for details.

          There is now a set of <literal>confinement</literal> options

              For users of NixOS 18.03 and 19.03, NixOS defaults to Nix
              2.0, but supports using Nix 1.11 by setting
              <literal>nix.package = pkgs.nix1;</literal>. If this
              option is set to a Nix 1.11 package, you will need to

              For users of NixOS 17.09, you will first need to upgrade
              Nix by setting
              <literal>nix.package = pkgs.nixStable2;</literal> and run
              <literal>nixos-rebuild switch</literal> as the

              For users of a daemon-less Nix installation on Linux or
              macOS, you can upgrade Nix by running
              <literal>curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh</literal>,
              or prior to doing a channel update, running
              <literal>nix-env -iA nix</literal>. If you have already
              run a channel update and Nix is no longer able to evaluate
              Nixpkgs, the error message printed should provide adequate
              directions for upgrading Nix.

          module have to belong to the <literal>video</literal> group in

          The <literal>nscd</literal> service now disables all caching
          of <literal>passwd</literal> and <literal>group</literal>
          databases by default. This was interferring with the correct
          functioning of the <literal>libnss_systemd.so</literal> module
          which is used by <literal>systemd</literal> to manage uids and
          usernames in the presence of <literal>DynamicUser=</literal>
          in systemd services. This was already the default behaviour in
          presence of <literal>services.sssd.enable = true</literal>
          because nscd caching would interfere with
          <literal>sssd</literal> in unpredictable ways as well. Because
          we’re using nscd not for caching, but for convincing glibc to
          find NSS modules in the nix store instead of an absolute path,
          we have decided to disable caching globally now, as it’s
          usually not the behaviour the user wants and can lead to
          surprising behaviour. Furthermore, negative caching of host
          lookups is also disabled now by default. This should fix the
          issue of dns lookups failing in the presence of an unreliable
          network.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the old behaviour is desired, this can be restored by
          setting the <literal>services.nscd.config</literal> option
          with the desired caching parameters.

          GitLab Shell previously used the nix store paths for the
          <literal>gitlab-shell</literal> command in its
          <literal>authorized_keys</literal> file, which might stop
          working after garbage collection. To circumvent that, we
          regenerated that file on each startup. As

          <literal>/var/run/current-system/sw/bin/gitlab-shell</literal>,
          this is not necessary anymore, but there might be leftover
          lines with a nix store path. Regenerate the

          <literal>sudo -u git -H gitlab-rake gitlab:shell:setup</literal>
          in that case.

          The <literal>pam_unix</literal> account module is now loaded
          with its control field set to <literal>required</literal>
          instead of <literal>sufficient</literal>, so that later PAM
          account modules that might do more extensive checks are being
          executed. Previously, the whole account module verification
          was exited prematurely in case a nss module provided the
          account name to <literal>pam_unix</literal>. The LDAP and SSSD
          NixOS modules already add their NSS modules when enabled. In
          case your setup breaks due to some later PAM account module
          previosuly shadowed, or failing NSS lookups, please file a
          bug. You can get back the old behaviour by manually setting
          <literal>security.pam.services.&lt;name?&gt;.text</literal>.

          The <literal>pam_unix</literal> password module is now loaded

          Previously, for example, changing an LDAP account’s password
          through PAM was not possible: the whole password module
          verification was exited prematurely by
          <literal>pam_unix</literal>, preventing
          <literal>pam_ldap</literal> to manage the password as it
