* Building Your Own NixOS CD

Building a NixOS CD is as easy as configuring your own computer. The
idea is to use another module which will replace your
=configuration.nix= to configure the system that would be installed on
the CD.

Default CD/DVD configurations are available inside
=nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git
  $ cd nixpkgs/nixos
  $ nix-build -A config.system.build.isoImage -I nixos-config=modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix default.nix
#+END_EXAMPLE

Before burning your CD/DVD, you can check the content of the image by
mounting anywhere like suggested by the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # mount -o loop -t iso9660 ./result/iso/cd.iso /mnt/iso
#+END_EXAMPLE
