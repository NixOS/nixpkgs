* NixOS Tests
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sec-nixos-tests
  :END:

When you add some feature to NixOS, you should write a test for it.
NixOS tests are kept in the directory =nixos/tests=, and are executed
(using Nix) by a testing framework that automatically starts one or more
virtual machines containing the NixOS system(s) required for the test.
