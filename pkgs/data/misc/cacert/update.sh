# Build both the cacert package and an overriden version where we use the source attribute of NSS.
# Cacert and NSS are both from the same upstream sources. They are decoupled as
# the cacert output only cares about a few infrequently changing files in the
# sources while the NSS source code changes frequently.
#
# By having cacert on a older source revision that produces the same
# certificate output as a newer version we can avoid large amounts of
# unnecessary rebuilds.
#
# As of this writing there are a few magnitudes more packages depending on
# cacert than on nss.
#
# If the current nixpkgs revision contains the attribute `nss_latest` that will
# be used instead of `nss`. This is done to help the stable branch maintenance
# where (usually) after branch-off during the first Firefox upgrade that
# requries a new NSS version that attribute is introduced.
# By having this change in the unstable branch we can safely carry it from
# release to release without requiring more backport churn on those doing the
# stable maintenance.
