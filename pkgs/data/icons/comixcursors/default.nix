      There are many (${toString ((length outputs) - 1)}) variants of color,
      opacity, edge thickness, and right- or left-handedness, for this cursor
      theme.  This package's derivation has an output for each of these
      variants, named following the upstream convention, and the attribute for
      an output must be used to install a variant,
      e.g. `comixcursors.LH_Opaque_Slim_Blue`.  Attempting to use only
      `comixcursors`, i.e. without an output attribute, will not install any
      variants.  To install all the variants, use `comixcursors.all` (which is a
      list).
