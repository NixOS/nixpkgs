      JuliaMono is a monospaced typeface designed for programming in the Julia Programming Language and in other text editing environments that require a wide range of specialist and technical Unicode characters. It was intended as an experiment to be presented at the 2020 JuliaCon conference in Lisbon, Portugal (which of course didnâ€™t happen).

      JuliaMono is:

      - free
      - distributed with a liberal licence
      - suitable for scientific and technical programming as well as for general purpose hacking
      - easy to use, simple, friendly, and approachable
