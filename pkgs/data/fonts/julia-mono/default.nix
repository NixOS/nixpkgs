      JuliaMono is a monospaced typeface designed for use in text editing
      environments that require a wide range of specialist and technical Unicode
      characters. It was intended as a fun experiment to be presented at the
      2020 JuliaCon conference in Lisbon, Portugal (which of course didnâ€™t
      physically happen in Lisbon, but online).
