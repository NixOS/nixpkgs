    longDescription = ''
      Inconsolata is one of the most suitable font for programmers created by Raph
      Levien. Since the original Inconsolata does not contain Cyrillic alphabet,
      it was slightly inconvenient for not a few programmers from Russia.

      Inconsolata LGC is a modified version of Inconsolata with added the Cyrillic
      alphabet which directly descends from Inconsolata Hellenic supporting modern
      Greek.

      Inconsolata LGC is licensed under SIL OFL.


      Inconsolata LGC changes:
      * Cyrillic glyphs added.
      * Italic and Bold font added.

      Changes inherited from Inconsolata Hellenic:
      * Greek glyphs.

      Changes inherited from Inconsolata-dz:
      * Straight quotation marks.
