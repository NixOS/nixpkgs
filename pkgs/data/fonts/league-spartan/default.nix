      A new classic, this is a bold, modern, geometric sans-serif that has no
      problem kicking its enemies in the chest.

      Taking a strong influence from ATF's classic Spartan family, we're
      starting our own family out with a single strong weight. We've put a few
      unique touches into a beautiful, historical typeface, and made sure to
      include an extensive characterset – currently totaling over 300 glyphs.

      Over time, the open-source license will allow us expand League Spartan
      into a full family, with multiple weights and styles, and we're starting
      by releasing our first Bold style for this exciting, modern classic now.
