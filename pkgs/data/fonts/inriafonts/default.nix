      Inria Sans and Inria Serif are the two members of a type family
      design for the communication of Inria, the French national institute
      dedicated to numeric research. The Institut needed a font
      showing its values at the crossroad of humanity, technology,
      excellence and creativity. Black[Foudry] created a humanist
      typeface with a unapologetically contemporary design as the
      Sans-serif part and a more rational axis and drawing for the
      serif. Both members comes in 3 weights with matching italics.
