      Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was
      expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida
      in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics where added, and
      most recently â€” a variable version.

      It features both old style and lining numerals, standard and
      discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as
      a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces
      than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

      It also has a sister display family, Raleway Dots.
