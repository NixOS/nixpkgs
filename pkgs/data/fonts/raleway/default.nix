    longDescription = ''
      Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was
      expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida
      in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics where added.

      It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining
      numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of
      diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric
      sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character
      set.

      It also has a sister display family, Raleway Dots.
