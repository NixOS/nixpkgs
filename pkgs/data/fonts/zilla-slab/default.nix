      Zilla Slab is Mozilla's core typeface, used
      for the Mozilla wordmark, headlines and
      throughout their designs. A contemporary
      slab serif, based on Typotheque's Tesla, it
      is constructed with smooth curves and true
      italics, which gives text an unexpectedly
      sophisticated industrial look and a friendly
      approachability in all weights.
