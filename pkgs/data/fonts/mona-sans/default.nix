    longDescription = ''
      A strong and versatile typeface, designed together with Degarism and
      inspired by industrial-era grotesques. Mona Sans works well across
      product, web, and print. Made to work well together with Mona Sans's
      sidekick, Hubot Sans.

      Mona Sans is a variable font. Variable fonts enable different variations
      of a typeface to be incorporated into one single file, and are supported
      by all major browsers, allowing for performance benefits and granular
      design control of the typeface's weight, width, and slant.
