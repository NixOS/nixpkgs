      Input is a font family designed for computer programming, data,
      and text composition. It was designed by David Jonathan Ross
      between 2012 and 2014 and published by The Font Bureau. It
      contains a wide array of styles so you can fine-tune the
      typography that works best in your editing environment.

      Input Mono is a monospaced typeface, where all characters occupy
      a fixed width. Input Sans and Serif are proportional typefaces
      that are designed with all of the features of a good monospace —
      generous spacing, large punctuation, and easily distinguishable
      characters — but without the limitations of a fixed width.
