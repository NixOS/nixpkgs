    longDescription = ''
      Lato is a sans-serif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by
      Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic ("Lato" means "Summer" in Polish).
      In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the open-source Open
      Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.

      In 2013-2014, the family was greatly extended to cover 3000+ glyphs per
      style. The Lato 2.010 family now supports 100+ Latin-based languages, 50+
      Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA phonetics. In the
      process, the metrics and kerning of the family have been revised and four
      additional weights were created.
