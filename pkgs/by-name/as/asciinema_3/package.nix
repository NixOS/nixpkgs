        asciinema is a suite of tools for recording, replaying, and sharing
        terminal sessions. It is free and open-source software (FOSS), created
        by Marcin Kulik.

        Its typical use cases include creating tutorials, demonstrating
        command-line tools, and sharing reproducible bug reports. It focuses on
        simplicity and interoperability, which makes it a popular choice among
        computer users working with the command-line, such as developers or
        system administrators.
