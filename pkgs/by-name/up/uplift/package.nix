      By harnessing the power of Conventional Commits, Uplift
      simplifies the release management of your project through your
      use of commit messages.

      Built for Continuous Integration (CI), Uplift is incredibly
      simple to use, and its modular design allows you to choose which
      release cycle features you want to incorporate into your
      workflow. It adheres to the Semantic Versioning specification
      and plays nicely with other tools.
