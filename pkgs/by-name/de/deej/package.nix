      deej is an open-source hardware volume mixer for Windows and Linux PCs.
      It lets you use real-life sliders (like a DJ!) to seamlessly control the volumes
      of different apps (such as your music player, the game you're playing and your voice
      chat session) without having to stop what you're doing.
