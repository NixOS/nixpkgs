    # to exist at build time (see #8567), so we create a git-hash.txt file and

    # decided to use a full commit hash. Full commit hashes are more
    # reproducible. The short hash “1234” might correspond to one commit today,
    # but correspond to two commits tomorrow. Full commit hashes don’t have
    # that problem.
