      Komodo is a web app to provide structure for managing your servers, builds, deployments, and automated procedures.

      With Komodo you can:
      * Connect all of your servers, and alert on CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage.
      * Create, start, stop, and restart Docker containers on the connected servers, and view their status and logs.
      * Deploy docker compose stacks. The file can be defined in UI, or in a git repo, with auto deploy on git push.
      * Build application source into auto-versioned Docker images, auto built on webhook. Deploy single-use AWS instances for infinite capacity.
      * Manage repositories on connected servers, which can perform automation via scripting / webhooks.
      * Manage all your configuration / environment variables, with shared global variable and secret interpolation.
      * Keep a record of all the actions that are performed and by whom.

      Komodo is composed of a single core and any amount of connected servers running the periphery application.
