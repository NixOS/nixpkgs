    longDescription = ''
      The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the ability to
      easily extract data from files archived in a single zip file.
      Applications can bundle files into a single zip archive and access them.
      The implementation is based only on the (free) subset of compression with
      the zlib algorithm which is actually used by the zip/unzip tools.
