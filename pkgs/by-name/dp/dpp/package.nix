      D++ (DPP) is a lightweight and simple library for Discord written in modern C++.
      It is designed to cover as much of the API specification as possible and to have
      an incredibly small memory footprint, even when caching large amounts of data.
      This package contains version ${finalAttrs.version} of the DPP library.
