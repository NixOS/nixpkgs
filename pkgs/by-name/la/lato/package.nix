      Lato is a sans-serif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010
      by Warsaw-based designer ﾅ「kasz Dziedzic ("Lato" means "Summer"
      in Polish).  In December 2010 the Lato family was published
      under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland,
      with support from Google.

      In 2013-2014, the family was greatly extended to cover 3000+
      glyphs per style. The Lato 2.010 family now supports 100+
      Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as
      Greek and IPA phonetics. In the process, the metrics and kerning
      of the family have been revised and four additional weights were
      created.
