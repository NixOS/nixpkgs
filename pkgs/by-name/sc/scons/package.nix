      SCons is an Open Source software construction tool. Think of SCons as an
      improved, cross-platform substitute for the classic Make utility with
      integrated functionality similar to autoconf/automake and compiler caches
      such as ccache. In short, SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way
      to build software.
