      ZIMPL is a little language to translate the mathematical model of a
      problem into a linear or (mixed-)integer mathematical program
      expressed in .lp or .mps file format which can be read by a LP or MIP
      solver.

      If you use Zimpl for research and publish results, the best way
      to refer to Zimpl is to cite my Ph.d. thesis:
