    longDescription = ''
      pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags
      for development libraries. It is similar to pkg-config from
      freedesktop.org.

      libpkgconf is a library which provides access to most of pkgconf's
      functionality, to allow other tooling such as compilers and IDEs to
      discover and use libraries configured by pkgconf.
