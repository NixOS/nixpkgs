      libvfn is a zero-dependency library for interacting with PCIe-based NVMe
      devices from user-space using the Linux kernel vfio-pci driver. The core
      of the library is excessively low-level and aims to allow controller
      verification and testing teams to interact with the NVMe device at the
      register and queue level.
