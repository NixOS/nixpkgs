# NOTE (aseipp): buck2 uses a precompiled binary build for good reason — the
# upstream codebase extensively uses unstable `rustc` nightly features, and as a
# result can't be built upstream in any sane manner. it is only ever tested and
# integrated against a single version of the compiler, which produces all usable
# binaries. you shouldn't try to workaround this or get clever and think you can
# patch it to work; just accept it for now. it is extremely unlikely buck2 will
# build with a stable compiler anytime soon; see related upstream issues:
#
#   - NixOS/nixpkgs#226677
#   - NixOS/nixpkgs#232471
#   - facebook/buck2#265
#   - facebook/buck2#322
#
# worth noting: it *is* possible to build buck2 from source using
# buildRustPackage, and it works fine, but only if you are using flakes and can
# import `rust-overlay` from somewhere else to vendor your compiler. See
# nixos/nixpkgs#226677 for more information about that.

# NOTE (aseipp): this expression is mostly automated, and you are STRONGLY
# RECOMMENDED to use to nix-update for updating this expression when new
# releases come out, which runs the sibling `update.sh` script.
#
# from the root of the nixpkgs git repository, run:
#
#    nix-shell maintainers/scripts/update.nix \
#      --argstr commit true \
#      --argstr package buck2
