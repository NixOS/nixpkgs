# patchPpdFileCommands PPD-ROOT PROGNAME...
#
# Look for ppd files in the directory PPD-ROOT.
# Descend into subdirectories, even if they are symlinks.
# However, ignore ppd files that don't belong to the same
# prefix ($NIX_STORE/$package_name) as PPD-ROOT-DIR does,
# to avoid stepping into other package's directories.
# ppd files may be gzipped; if the are,
# uncompress them, later recompress them.
# Skip symlinks to ppd files.
# PPD-ROOT may also be a single ppd file.
#
# Look for the PROGNAME executable in outputs and `buildInputs`,
# then look for PROGNAME invocations in the ppd files,
# without path or with common paths like `/usr/bin/$PROGNAME`.
# Replace those invocations with an absolute path to the
# corresponding executable from the outputs or `buildInputs`.
# Executables are searched where CUPS would search them,
# i.e., in `/bin` and `/lib/cups/filter`.
#
# As soon as an executable's path is replaced as
# described above, the package containing the binary
# is added to the list of propagated build inputs.
# This ensures the executable's package is still
# recognized as runtime dependency of the ppd file
# even if the ppd file is compressed lateron.
#
# PROGNAME may not contain spaces or tabs.
# The function will also likely fail or produce
# broken results if PROGNAME contains characters that
# require shell or regex escaping (e.g. a backslash).
