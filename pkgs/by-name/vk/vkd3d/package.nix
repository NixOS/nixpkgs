      Vkd3d is a 3D graphics library built on top of Vulkan. It has an API very
      similar, but not identical, to Direct3D 12.

      Vkd3d can be used by projects that target Direct3D 12 as a drop-in
      replacement at build-time with some modest source modifications.

      If vkd3d is available when building Wine, then Wine will use it to support
      Direct3D 12 applications.
