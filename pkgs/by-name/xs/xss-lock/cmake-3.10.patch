Subject: [PATCH] Update CMake minimum required version to 3.10

CMake 4 removed compatibility with CMake versions < 3.5, and versions
between 3.5-3.10 are deprecated.

This change updates the minimum required version to 3.10 to ensure
compatibility with modern CMake versions including CMake 4.x.

This issue is affecting NixOS users (see
https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/450274) and will likely impact
other distributions as they upgrade to CMake 4.x.
