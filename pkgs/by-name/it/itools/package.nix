      The itools package is a set of user friendly applications utilizing Arabeyes' ITL library.

      The package addresses two main areas - hijri date and prayertime calculation. The package
      is envisioned to mimick the development of the underlying ITL library and is meant to
      always give the end-user a simple means to access its functions.
