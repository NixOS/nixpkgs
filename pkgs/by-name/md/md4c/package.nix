    longDescription = ''
      MD4C is Markdown parser implementation in C, with the following features:

      - Compliance: Generally, MD4C aims to be compliant to the latest version
        of CommonMark specification. Currently, we are fully compliant to
        CommonMark 0.30.
      - Extensions: MD4C supports some commonly requested and accepted
        extensions. See below.
      - Performance: MD4C is very fast.
      - Compactness: MD4C parser is implemented in one source file and one
        header file. There are no dependencies other than standard C library.
      - Embedding: MD4C parser is easy to reuse in other projects, its API is
        very straightforward: There is actually just one function, md_parse().
      - Push model: MD4C parses the complete document and calls few callback
        functions provided by the application to inform it about a start/end of
        every block, a start/end of every span, and with any textual contents.
      - Portability: MD4C builds and works on Windows and POSIX-compliant
        OSes. (It should be simple to make it run also on most other platforms,
        at least as long as the platform provides C standard library, including
        a heap memory management.)
      - Encoding: MD4C by default expects UTF-8 encoding of the input
        document. But it can be compiled to recognize ASCII-only control
        characters (i.e. to disable all Unicode-specific code), or (on Windows)
        to expect UTF-16 (i.e. what is on Windows commonly called just
        "Unicode"). See more details below.
      - Permissive license: MD4C is available under the MIT license.
