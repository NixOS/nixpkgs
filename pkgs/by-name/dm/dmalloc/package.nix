    longDescription = ''
      The debug memory allocation or "dmalloc" library has been designed as a
      drop in replacement for the system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free and
      other memory management routines while providing powerful debugging
      facilities configurable at runtime. These facilities include such things
      as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write detection, file/line number
      reporting, and general logging of statistics.
