  # In general, the official site should be used for naming (e.g. pakHD, pakHAJO),

      # The game has three directories it reads data from:
      #
      # - The "base" directory, which is the directory containing resources included in the package.
      #   This will be in the nix store, and is read-only. In our case, it's $out/share/simutrans.
      #
      # - The "user" directory, which is the directory containing user data.
      #   This must be writable; it's in the user's home directory. It's where the game saves games, settings, etc.
      #
      # - The "install" directory, which also must be writable.
      #   This is where the in-game pakset installer downloads to.
      #
      # The base directory is special, it is specified with '-set_basedir' or argv[0].
      # The argv0 value will be $out/bin/simutrans, which contains no resources. We set it with '-set_basedir'.
      #
      # The user and install directories are more similar, and can be set with '-set_userdir' and '-set_installdir'.
      # However, the user might reasonably want to set these directories manually.
      # So, we set them with environment variables, and the game will use them if they are set.
      # The game reads from $SIMUTRANS_USERDIR and $SIMUTRANS_INSTALLDIR.
      # There is no equivalent environment variable for the base directory. (argv[0] i guess)
      #
      # By default, the game will respect $XDG_DATA_HOME and place its files in $XDG_DATA_HOME/simutrans.
      # If $XDG_DATA_DIR is not set, it will break the XDG spec and place its files in ~/simutrans.
      # The XDG spec says that the default should be ~/.local/share/simutrans in that case.
      # (that is, the default value for the "user" directory is ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME}/simutrans)
      #
      # The value for the "user" directory is the first of these that is valid:
      # - '-set_userdir' command line argument
      # - $SIMUTRANS_USERDIR
      # - $XDG_DATA_HOME/simutrans
      # - ~/simutrans
      #
      # The default value for the "install" directory is the "user" directory with /paksets appended.
      # Its user-settable parameters are analogous to the "user" directory.
      #
      # Prior to version 124.0, none of this was applicable. The game only ever used ~/simutrans and $PWD.
      # The previous versions of this package in nixpkgs would patch the game to use ~/.simutrans instead.
      #
      # For backwards compatibility, it is desirable to default to ~/.simutrans still, if it already exists,
      # but prefer using $XDG_DATA_HOME/simutrans in all other cases. That is what `default-home` is for.
      # It will be set to ~/.simutrans if and only if it exists, otherwise it will be set to "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/simutrans".
      # That is, we intentionally follow the XDG basedir spec, and **override the default behaviour of the executable here**,
      # which, again, wouldn't normally follow the XDG basedir spec. It normally wants "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME}/simutrans" (which we override)
      #
      # Then, we use it to set defaults for SIMUTRANS_USERDIR and SIMUTRANS_INSTALLDIR.
      # These should be '--set-default's, but wrapProgram will only accept literal strings here.
      # We're reading from the environment, so we use --run instead.
      #
      # A user can overwrite these values:
      # - Setting SIMUTRANS_USERDIR and SIMUTRANS_INSTALLDIR in the environment will take priority over these defaults.
      # - Setting SIMUTRANS_USERDIR and SIMUTRANS_INSTALLDIR to empty strings will disable them.
      # - Passing '-set_userdir' and '-set_installdir' to the game will take priority over the environment variables.
