      SillyTavern is a user interface you can install on your computer (and Android phones) that allows you to interact with
      text generation AIs and chat/roleplay with characters you or the community create.

      This package makes a global installation, instead of a standalone installation according to the official tutorial.
      See [the official documentation](https://docs.sillytavern.app/installation/#global--standalone-mode) for the context.
