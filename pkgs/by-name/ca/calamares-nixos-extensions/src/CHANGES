This is the changelog for Calamares-Extensions. For each release, the major
changes and contributors are listed. Note that Calamares-Extensions does not
have a historical changelog -- this log starts with version 1.0.0.

# 1.2.1 (2021-11-16)

The 1.2.0 release had no release-notes for that version, and failed to
credit Anke and Otus.

Changes and new modules in this release:
 - *unpackfsc* can use `fsarchiver` and unpack that, instead of squashfs;
   a distro might choose one tool or the other. Currently, only *savedir* /
   *restdir* mode (i.e. directories, not block-devices) are supported.

# 1.2.0 (2021-11-16)

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Anke Boersma
 - Otus9051

Changes and new modules in this release:
 - *refind* is a new module that installs the rEFInd bootloader. It can
   be used instead of the *bootloader* module from core Calamares. (Thanks Anke)
 - *unpackfsc* is a new module that uses `unsquashfs` directly. This may
   be faster or more convenient than the *unpackfs* module from core Calamares.
   The configuration file supports only one entry, but is otherwise easy to
   adapt from an existing `unpackfs.conf`.


# 1.1.2 (2021-05-14)

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Oliver Smith

Changes and new modules in this release:
 - New *os-* modules are intended for OS-specific work. They don't
   do anything concrete yet, though.
 - The *mobile* module has new features thanks to Oliver, with
   keyboard selection (numeric / alpha) for PIN / password entry among them.

   slideshow with only images.
