# Configuration for the one-user-system user module.
#
# Besides these settings, the user module also places the following
# keys into the globalconfig area, based on user input in the view step.
#
# - hostname
# - username
# - password (obscured)
# - autologinUser (if enabled, set to username)
#
# These globalconfig keys are set when the jobs for this module
# are created.
---
# Used as default groups for the created user.
# Adjust to your Distribution defaults.
defaultGroups:
    - users
    - networkmanager
    - wheel
# Are not actually used by nixos module right now

# Some Distributions require a 'autologin' group for the user.
# Autologin causes a user to become automatically logged in to
# the desktop environment on boot.
# Disable when your Distribution does not require such a group.
autologinGroup:
# You can control the initial state for the 'autologin checkbox' here.
# Possible values are:
#  - true to check or
#  - false to uncheck
# These set the **initial** state of the checkbox.
doAutologin: false

# When *sudoersGroup* is set to a non-empty string, Calamares creates a
# sudoers file for the user. This file is located at:
#     `/etc/sudoers.d/10-installer`
# Remember to add the (value of) *sudoersGroup* to *defaultGroups*.
#
# If your Distribution already sets up a group of sudoers in its packaging,
# remove this setting (delete or comment out the line below). Otherwise,
# the setting will be duplicated in the `/etc/sudoers.d/10-installer` file,
# potentially confusing users.
# sudoersGroup: wheel

# Setting this to false, causes the root account to be disabled.
# When disabled, hides the "Use the same password for administrator"
# checkbox. Also hides the "Choose a password" and associated text-inputs.
setRootPassword: true

# You can control the initial state for the 'reuse password for root'
# checkbox here. Possible values are:
#  - true to check or
#  - false to uncheck
#
# When checked, the user password is used for the root account too.
#
# NOTE: *doReusePassword* requires *setRootPassword* to be enabled.
doReusePassword: false

# These are optional password-requirements that a distro can enforce
# on the user. The values given in this sample file set only very weak
# validation settings.
#
# - nonempty rejects empty passwords
# - there are no length validations
# - libpwquality (if it is enabled at all) has no length of class
#   restrictions, although it will still reject palindromes and
#   dictionary words with these settings.
#
# Checks may be listed multiple times; each is checked separately,
# and no effort is done to ensure that the checks are consistent
# (e.g. specifying a maximum length less than the minimum length
# will annoy users).
#
# The libpwquality check relies on the (optional) libpwquality library.
# Its value is a list of configuration statements that could also
# be found in pwquality.conf, and these are handed off to the
# libpwquality parser for evaluation. The check is ignored if
# libpwquality is not available at build time (generates a warning in
# the log). The Calamares password check rejects passwords with a
# score of < 40 with the given libpwquality settings.
#
# (additional checks may be implemented in CheckPWQuality.cpp and
# wired into UsersPage.cpp)
#
#  - To disable specific password validations:
#    comment out the relevant 'passwordRequirements' keys below.
#  - To disable all password validations:
#    set both 'allowWeakPasswords' and 'allowWeakPasswordsDefault' to true.
#    (That will show the box *Allow weak passwords* in the user-
#    interface, and check it by default).
passwordRequirements:
    nonempty: true
    minLength: -1  # Password at least this many characters
    maxLength: -1  # Password at most this many characters
    libpwquality:
        - minlen=0
        - minclass=0

# You can control the visibility of the 'strong passwords' checkbox here.
# Possible values are:
#  - true to show or
#  - false to hide  (default)
# the checkbox. This checkbox allows the user to choose to disable
# password-strength-checks. By default the box is **hidden**, so
# that you have to pick a password that satisfies the checks.
allowWeakPasswords: true
# You can control the initial state for the 'strong passwords' checkbox here.
# Possible values are:
#  - true to uncheck or
#  - false to check (default)
# the checkbox by default. Since the box is labeled to enforce strong
# passwords, in order to **allow** weak ones by default, the box needs
# to be unchecked.
allowWeakPasswordsDefault: false

# Shell to be used for the regular user of the target system.
# There are three possible kinds of settings:
#  - unset (i.e. commented out, the default), act as if set to /bin/bash
#  - empty (explicit), don't pass shell information to useradd at all
#    and rely on a correct configuration file in /etc/default/useradd
#  - set, non-empty, use that path as shell. No validation is done
#    that the shell actually exists or is executable.
userShell: /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash

# Hostname setting
#
# The user can enter a hostname; this is configured into the system
# in some way; pick one of:
#   - *None*, to not set the hostname at all
#   - *EtcFile*, to write to `/etc/hostname` directly
#   - *Hostnamed*, to use systemd hostnamed(1) over DBus
# The default is *EtcFile*.
setHostname: None

# Should /etc/hosts be written with a hostname for this machine
# (also adds localhost and some ipv6 standard entries).
writeHostsFile: false
