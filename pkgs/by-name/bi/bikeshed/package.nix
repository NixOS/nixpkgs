      Bikeshed is a pre-processor for spec documents, turning a source document
      (containing only the actual spec content, plus several shorthands for linking
      to terms and other things) into a final spec document, with appropriate boilerplate,
      bibliography, indexes, etc all filled in. It's used on specs for CSS
      and many other W3C working groups, WHATWG, the C++ standards committee, and elsewhere!
