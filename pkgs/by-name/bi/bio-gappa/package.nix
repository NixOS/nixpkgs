      gappa is a collection of commands for working with phylogenetic data. Its
      main focus are evolutionary placements of short environmental sequences
      on a reference phylogenetic tree. Such data are typically produced by
      tools such as EPA-ng, RAxML-EPA or pplacer, and usually stored in jplace
      files.
