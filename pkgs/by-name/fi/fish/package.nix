    #                                                                             #
    # Origin:
    #     This fish package was called with the attribute
    #     "useOperatingSystemEtc = true;".
    #
    # Purpose:
    #     Fish ordinarily sources /etc/fish/config.fish as
    #        $__fish_sysconfdir/config.fish,
    #     and $__fish_sysconfdir is defined at compile-time, baked into the C++
    #     component of fish. By default, it is set to "/etc/fish". When building
    #     through Nix, $__fish_sysconfdir gets set to $out/etc/fish. Here we may
    #     have included a custom $out/etc/config.fish in the fish package,
    #     as specified, but according to the value of useOperatingSystemEtc, we
    #     may want to further source the real "/etc/fish/config.fish" file.
    #
    #     When this option is enabled, this segment should appear the very end of
    #     "$out/etc/config.fish". This is to emulate the behavior of fish itself
    #     with respect to /etc/fish/config.fish and ~/.config/fish/config.fish:
    #     source both, but source the more global configuration files earlier
    #     than the more local ones, so that more local configurations inherit
    #     from but override the more global locations.
    #
    #     Special care needs to be taken, when fish is called from an FHS user env
    #     or similar setup, because this configuration file will then be relocated
    #     to /etc/fish/config.fish, so we test for this case to avoid nontermination.
