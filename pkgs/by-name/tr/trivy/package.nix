      Trivy is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers
      and other artifacts. A software vulnerability is a glitch, flaw, or
      weakness present in the software or in an Operating System. Trivy detects
      vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and
      application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.).
