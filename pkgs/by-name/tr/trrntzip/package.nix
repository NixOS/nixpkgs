      Torrentzip converts zip archives to a standard format with some
      pre-defined values, sorting the files, and using particular compression
      settings so that running it on zip archives created by other tools will
      always result in the same output. This helps e.g. with sharing
      zip archives using BitTorrent (which is where the name comes from).
