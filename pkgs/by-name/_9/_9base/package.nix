      9base is a port of various original Plan 9 tools for Unix, based on plan9port.
      It also contains the Plan 9 libc, libbio, libregexp, libfmt and libutf.
      The overall SLOC is about 66kSLOC, so this userland + all libs is much smaller than, e.g. bash.
      9base can be used to run werc instead of the full blown plan9port.
