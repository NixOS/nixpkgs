      SoftHSM provides a software implementation of a generic
      cryptographic device with a PKCS#11 interface, which is of
      course especially useful in environments where a dedicated hardware
      implementation of such a device - for instance a Hardware
      Security Module (HSM) or smartcard - is not available.

      SoftHSM follows the OASIS PKCS#11 standard, meaning it should be
      able to work with many cryptographic products. SoftHSM is a
      programme of The Commons Conservancy.
