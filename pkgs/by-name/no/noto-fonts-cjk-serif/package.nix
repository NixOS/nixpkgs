    longDescription = ''
      Noto Serif CJK is a serif typeface designed as
      an intermediate style between the modern and traditional. It is
      intended to be a multi-purpose digital font for user interface
      designs, digital content, reading on laptops, mobile devices, and
      electronic books. Noto Serif CJK comprehensively covers
      Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in a
      unified font family. It supports regional variants of ideographic
      characters for each of the four languages. In addition, it supports
      Japanese kana, vertical forms, and variant characters (itaiji); it
      supports Korean hangeul â€” both contemporary and archaic.
