      A decentralised storage and communication system for a sovereign digital society.

      Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes that create a decentralised storage
      and communication service. The system is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in
      incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

      Bee is a Swarm node implementation, written in Go.
