      This is a fork of sm64ex-coop, which was itself a fork of sm64ex, which was a fork of the sm64 decompilation project.

      It allows multiple people to play within and across levels, has multiple character models, and mods in the form of lua scripts.

      Arguments:

      - `enableTextureFix`: (default: `true`) whether to enable texture fixes. Upstream describes disabling this as "for purists"
      - `enableDiscord`: (default: `true`) whether to enable discord integration, which allows showing status and connecting to games over discord
      - `enableCoopNet`: (default: `true`) whether to enable Co-op Net integration, a server made specifically for multiplayer sm64
