      When Edgar's father fails to return home after venturing out one dark and
      stormy night, Edgar fears the worst: he has been captured by the evil
      sorcerer who lives in a fortress beyond the forbidden swamp.

      Donning his armour, Edgar sets off to rescue him, but his quest will not
      be easy...

      The Legend of Edgar is a platform game, not unlike those found on the
      Amiga and SNES. Edgar must battle his way across the world, solving
      puzzles and defeating powerful enemies to achieve his quest.
