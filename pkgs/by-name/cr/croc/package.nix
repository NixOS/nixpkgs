      Croc is a command line tool written in Go that allows any two computers to
      simply and securely transfer files and folders.

      Croc does all of the following:
      - Allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)
      - Provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)
      - Enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
      - Allows multiple file transfers
      - Allows resuming transfers that are interrupted
      - Does not require a server or port-forwarding
