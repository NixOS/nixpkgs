      CrateDB is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze massive
      amounts of data in real-time.

      CrateDB offers the benefits of an SQL database and the scalability and flexibility typically
      associated with NoSQL databases. Modest CrateDB clusters can ingest tens of thousands of records
      per second without breaking a sweat. You can run ad-hoc queries using standard SQL.
      CrateDB's blazing-fast distributed query execution engine parallelizes query workloads across
      the whole cluster.
