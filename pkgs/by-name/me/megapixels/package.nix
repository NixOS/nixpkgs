    # In the settings menu of Megapixels the user can select a different postprocessing script. The path to the script is then stored in a dconf setting. If the path changes, for example because it is in the Nix store and a dependency of the postprocessor changes, Megapixels will try to use this now non-existing old path. This will cause Megapixels to not save any images that were taken until the user opens the settings again and selects a postprocessor again. Using a global path allows the setting to keep working.
    # Note that this patch only fixes the issue for external postprocessors like postprocessd but the postprocessor script that comes with Megapixels is still refered to by the Nix store path.
