      CLD2 probabilistically detects over 80 languages in Unicode UTF-8 text,
      either plain text or HTML/XML. Legacy encodings must be converted to valid
      UTF-8 by the caller. For mixed-language input, CLD2 returns the top three
      languages found and their approximate percentages of the total text bytes
      (e.g. 80% English and 20% French out of 1000 bytes of text means about 800
      bytes of English and 200 bytes of French). Optionally, it also returns a
      vector of text spans with the language of each identified. This may be
      useful for applying different spelling-correction dictionaries or
      different machine translation requests to each span. The design target is
      web pages of at least 200 characters (about two sentences); CLD2 is not
      designed to do well on very short text, lists of proper names, part
      numbers, etc.
