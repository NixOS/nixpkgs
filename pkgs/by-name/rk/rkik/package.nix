    longDescription = ''
      Most systems rely on a daemon (like chronyd or ntpd) to
      synchronize time. But what if you just want to inspect the
      current offset between your system clock and one or more NTP
      servers â€” without root, without sync, and without installing
      anything heavyweight?

      RKIK is a Rust-based CLI tool designed for stateless and passive
      NTP inspection, just as dig or ping are for DNS and ICMP.
