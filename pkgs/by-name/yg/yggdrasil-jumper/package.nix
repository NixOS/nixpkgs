      An independent project that aims to transparently reduce latency
      of a connection over Yggdrasil network, utilizing NAT traversal to
      bypass intermediary nodes. It periodically probes for active sessions
      and automatically establishes direct peerings over internet with
      remote nodes running Yggdrasil-Jumper without requiring any firewall
      configuration or port mapping.
