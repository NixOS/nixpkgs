A simple-as-possible demonstration of building a Rust program for the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target using `pkgsCross.wasm32-unknown-none`.

This is a common target for web applications written in Rust, and this package
ensures the `pkgsCross.wasm32-unknown-none.rustPlatform` is tested and cached.
