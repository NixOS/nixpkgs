      Blightmud is a terminal client for connecting to Multi User Dungeon (MUD)
      games. It is written in Rust and supports TLS, GMCP, MSDP, MCCP2, tab
      completion, text searching and a split view for scrolling. Blightmud can
      be customized with Lua scripting for aliases, triggers, timers, customized
      status bars, and more. Blightmud supports several accessibility features
      including an optional built-in text-to-speech engine and a screen reader
      friendly mode.
