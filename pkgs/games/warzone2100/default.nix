        Warzone 2100 is an open source real-time strategy and real-time tactics
      hybrid computer game, originally developed by Pumpkin Studios and
      published by Eidos Interactive.
        In Warzone 2100, you command the forces of The Project in a battle to
      rebuild the world after mankind has almost been destroyed by nuclear
      missiles. The game offers campaign, multi-player, and single-player
      skirmish modes. An extensive tech tree with over 400 different
      technologies, combined with the unit design system, allows for a wide
      variety of possible units and tactics.
