# To whomever it may concern:
#
# This directory menaces with spikes of Nix code. It is terrifying.
#
# If this is your first time here, you should probably install the dwarf-fortress-full package,
# for instance with `environment.systempackages = [ pkgs.dwarf-fortress.dwarf-fortress-full ];`.
#
# You can adjust its settings by using override, or compile your own package by
# using the other packages here. Take a look at lazy-pack.nix to get an idea of
# how.
#
# You will find the configuration files in ~/.local/share/df_linux/data/init. If
# you un-symlink them and edit, then the scripts will avoid overwriting your
# changes on later launches, but consider extending the wrapper with your
# desired options instead.
#
# Although both dfhack and dwarf therapist are included in the lazy pack, you
# can only use one at a time. DFHack does have therapist-like features, so this
# may or may not be a problem.
