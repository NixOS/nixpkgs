Maintainers, please read me!

The policy for updates is currently keeping one major version of DF around since 0.44.
See [Save Compatibility](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Save_compatibility)
on the DF wiki. Note that saves are backwards compatible, but not forwards-compatible.

This policy has been in effect since Nixpkgs 25.05.
