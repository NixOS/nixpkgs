    longDescription = ''
      Harmonist is a stealth coffee-break roguelike game. The game has a heavy
      focus on tactical positioning, light and noise mechanisms, making use of
      various terrain types and cones of view for monsters. Aiming for a
      replayable streamlined experience, the game avoids complex inventory
      management and character building, relying on items and player
      adaptability for character progression.
