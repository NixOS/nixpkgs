      Infra Arcana is a Roguelike set in the early 20th century. The goal is to
      explore the lair of a dreaded cult called The Church of Starry Wisdom.

      Buried deep beneath their hallowed grounds lies an artifact called The
      Shining Trapezohedron - a window to all secrets of the universe. Your
      ultimate goal is to unearth this artifact.
