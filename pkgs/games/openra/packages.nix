      Although `callPackage` could be used, it would require undoing `makeOverridable`,
      because `common.nix` does not define a package, but just an attribute set,
      which is directly passed as part of the argument to the engines and mods `callPackage`,

      or the engine and mod package definitions will need to add `...` to the argument list.

      Not all dependencies for defining a engine or mod set are shared,

      The builders for engines and mods allow to delay specifying the name,
      by returning a function that expects a name, which we use, in this case,
