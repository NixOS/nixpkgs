/*  This file defines all OpenRA packages under `openraPackages`,
    e.g. the OpenRA release engine can be found at `openraPackages.engines.release` (see `engines.nix`),
    or the out-of-tree mod "Combined Arms" can be found at `openraPackages.mods.ca` (see `mods.nix`).
    The `openra` package is just an alias to `openraPackages.engines.release`,
    and just provides the mods included in the source code of the engine.
    Additional engines or mods can be added with `openraPackages.buildOpenRAEngine` (function around `engine.nix`)
    and `openraPackages.buildOpenRAMod` (function around `mod.nix`), respectively.

      Although `callPackage` could be used, it would require undoing `makeOverridable`,
      because `common.nix` does not define a package, but just an attribute set,
      which is directly passed as part of the argument to the engines and mods `callPackage`,
