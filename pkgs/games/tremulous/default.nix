    longDescription = ''
      Tremulous is a free, open source game that blends a team based FPS with
      elements of an RTS. Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and
      humans. Players on both teams are able to build working structures
      in-game like an RTS. These structures provide many functions, the most
      important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are
      spawn structures or other players will not be able to rejoin the game
      after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some
      degree), healing functions and much more...
