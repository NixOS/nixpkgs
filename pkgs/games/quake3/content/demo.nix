      Quake III Arena and it's demo don't offer current wide screen resolutions in the menu.

      To switch to such a resolution, you will have to enter something like this in the quake console (invoke with ~ by default)

      r_mode -1; r_customwidth 1920; r_customheight 1080; r_fullscreen 1; vid_restart

      Or call the quake commandline with these parameters

      $ quake3 +set r_mode -1 +set r_customwidth 1920 +set r_customheight 1080 +set r_fullscreen 1 +vid_restart
