      GemRB (Game engine made with pre-Rendered Background) is a portable
      open-source implementation of Bioware's Infinity Engine. It was written to
      support pseudo-3D role playing games based on the Dungeons & Dragons
      ruleset (Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, Planescape: Torment).
