        Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it is a lot
        more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly
        decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

        Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from
        Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and
        scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless. For example:

        * learning a language
        * studying for medical and law exams
        * memorizing people's names and faces
        * brushing up on geography
        * mastering long poems
        * even practicing guitar chords!
