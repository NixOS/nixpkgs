      The demo simply draws a vertical bar moving accross the screen at constant speed, but deliberately rendered at a variable frame rate.

      The min and max frame rates can be manually changed at runtime, by step of 10 fps and with a min of 10 fps.

      The demo also allows to toggle V-Sync on/off.
