    longDescription = ''
      PGF is a macro package for creating graphics.  It is platform-
      and format-independent and works together with the most
      important TeX backend drivers, including pdftex and dvips.  It
      comes with a user-friedly syntax layer called TikZ.

      Its usage is similar to pstricks and the standard picture
      environment.  PGF works with plain (pdf-)TeX, (pdf-)LaTeX, and
      ConTeXt.  Unlike pstricks , it can produce either PostScript or
      PDF output.
