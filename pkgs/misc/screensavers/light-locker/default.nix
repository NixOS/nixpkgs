    longDescription = ''
      A simple locker (forked from gnome-screensaver) that aims to
      have simple, sane, secure defaults and be well integrated with
      the desktop while not carrying any desktop-specific
      dependencies.

      It relies on LightDM for locking and unlocking your session via
      ConsoleKit/UPower or logind/systemd.
