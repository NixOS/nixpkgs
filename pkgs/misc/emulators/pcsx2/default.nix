      PCSX2 is an open-source PlayStation 2 (AKA PS2) emulator. Its purpose
      is to emulate the PS2 hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU
      Interpreters, Recompilers and a Virtual Machine which manages hardware
      states and PS2 system memory. This allows you to play PS2 games on your
      PC, with many additional features and benefits.
