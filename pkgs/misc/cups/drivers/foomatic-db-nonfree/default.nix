    longDescription = ''
      The collected knowledge about printers,
      drivers, and driver options in XML files,
      used by `foomatic-db-engine` to generate PPD files.
      This is a package of PPD and Foomatic XML files
      that may have restrictions that keep them
      from being used on a variety of machines
      for licensing and other non-technical reasons.
      The XML files in this package enable `foomatic-db-ppds`
      to create about 120 additional PPD files, for printer from
      Dell, Genicom, Lexmark, Oce, Tektronix and Xerox.
      Besides the XML files, this package contains
      about 130 PPD files, for printers from
      Dell, Genicom, Lexmark, Oce and Xerox.
