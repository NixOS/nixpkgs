      The collected knowledge about printers,
      drivers, and driver options in XML files,
      used by `foomatic-db-engine` to generate PPD files.
      PPD files generated from the XML files in this package
      are contained in the package 'foomatic-db-ppds'.
      Besides the XML files, this package contains
      about 6,700 PPD files, for printers from
      Brother, Canon, Epson, Gestetner, HP, InfoPrint,
      Infotec, KONICA_MINOLTA, Kyocera, Lanier, Lexmark, NRG,
      Oce, Oki, Ricoh, Samsung, Savin, Sharp, Toshiba and Utax.
