# Tested on linux-x86_64.  Might work on linux-i386.  Probably won't work on anything else.

# To use this driver in NixOS, add it to printing.drivers in configuration.nix.
# configuration.nix might look like this when you're done:
# { pkgs, ... }: {
#   printing = {
#     enable = true;
#     drivers = [ pkgs.samsungUnifiedLinuxDriver ];
#   };
#   (more stuff)
# }
# (This advice was tested on 2010 August 2.)
