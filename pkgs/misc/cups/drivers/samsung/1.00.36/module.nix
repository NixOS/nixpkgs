# the original samsung-unified-linux-driver_1_00_36 has some paths
# hardcoded in binary files
#
# nixos samsung-unified-linux-driver_1_00_36 tries to fix those paths
# by patching the binaries
#
# this module is needed to put the expected files in the new paths
#
# printing works without problems
#
# scanning works, except one detail: sometimes it is possible to scan
# more pages in sequence.  most of the time though, scanning stops
# working after one page.  this problem happens both with scanimage
# and simple-scan.  errors indicate an I/O error.  scanning works
# again after turning the device off and on.  atm i have no idea how
# to fix this and no time to do more about it.
