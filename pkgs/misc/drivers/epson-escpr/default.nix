      Epson Inkjet Printer Driver (ESC/P-R) for Linux and the
      corresponding PPD files. The list of supported printers
      can be found at http://www.openprinting.org/driver/epson-escpr/ .

      To use the driver adjust your configuration.nix file:
        services.printing = {
          enable = true;
          drivers = [ pkgs.epson-escpr ];
        };

      To setup a wireless printer, enable Avahi which provides
      printer's hostname to CUPS and nss-mdns to make this
      hostname resolvable:
        services.avahi = {
          enable = true;
          nssmdns = true;
        };'';
