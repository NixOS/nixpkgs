  # The `file` command is added here because an enormous number of
  # packages have a vendored dependency upon `file` in their
  # `./configure` script, due to libtool<=2.4.6, or due to
  # libtool>=2.4.7 in which the package author decided to set FILECMD
  # when running libtoolize.  In fact, file-5.4.6 *depends on itself*
  # and tries to invoke `file` from its own ./configure script.
