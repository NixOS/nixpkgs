# The basic algorithm is to rewrite the propagated inputs of a package and any of its
# own propagated inputs recursively to replace references from the default SDK with
# those from the requested SDK version. This is done across all propagated inputs to
# avoid making assumptions about how those inputs are being used.
#
# For example, packages may propagate target-target dependencies with the expectation that
# they will be just build inputs when the package itself is used as a native build input.
#
# To support this use case and operate without regard to the original package set,
# `overrideSDK` creates a mapping from the default SDK in all package categories to the
# requested SDK. If the lookup fails, it is assumed the package is not part of the SDK.
# Non-SDK packages are processed per the algorithm described above.
