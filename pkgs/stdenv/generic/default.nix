  ## Platform parameters
  ##
  ## The "build" "host" "target" terminology below comes from GNU Autotools. See
  ## its documentation for more information on what those words mean. Note that
  ## each should always be defined, even when not cross compiling.
  ##
  ## For purposes of bootstrapping, think of each stage as a "sliding window"
  ## over a list of platforms. Specifically, the host platform of the previous
  ## stage becomes the build platform of the current one, and likewise the
  ## target platform of the previous stage becomes the host platform of the
  ## current one.
  ##

, # The platform on which packages are built. Consists of `system`, a
  # string (e.g.,`i686-linux') identifying the most import attributes of the
  # build platform, and `platform` a set of other details.
  buildPlatform

, # The platform on which packages run.
  hostPlatform

, # The platform which build tools (especially compilers) build for in this stage,
  targetPlatform
