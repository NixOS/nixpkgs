  ## Platform parameters
  ##
  ## The "build" "host" "target" terminology below comes from GNU Autotools. See
  ## its documentation for more information on what those words mean. Note that
  ## each should always be defined, even when not cross compiling.
  ##
  ## For purposes of bootstrapping, think of each stage as a "sliding window"
  ## over a list of platforms. Specifically, the host platform of the previous
  ## stage becomes the build platform of the current one, and likewise the
  ## target platform of the previous stage becomes the host platform of the
  ## current one.

  # build platform, and `platform` a set of other details.
