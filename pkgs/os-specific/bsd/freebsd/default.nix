      FreeBSD branches normally look like one of:
      * `release/<major>.<minor>.0` for tagged releases without security updates
      * `releng/<major>.<minor>` for release update branches with security updates
      * `stable/<major>` for stable versions working towards the next minor release
      * `main` for the latest development version

      Branches can be selected by overriding the `branch` attribute on the freebsd package set.

  # parameter to this file will only ever take on one value - more values
