Subject: [PATCH] inherit systemd environment when calling generators.

Systemd generators need access to the environment configured in
stage-2-init.sh since it schedules fsck and mkfs executions based on
being able to find an appropriate binary for the target filesystem.

With this commit I am altering the systemd behaviour since upstream
tries to gather environments with that they call
"environment-generators" and then seems to pass that on to all the other
executables that are being called from managers.
