Subject: [PATCH 19/19] core: handle lookup paths being symlinks

With a recent change paths leaving the statically known lookup paths
would be treated differently then those that remained within those. That
was done (AFAIK) to consistently handle alias names. Unfortunately that
means that on some distributions, especially those where /etc/ consists
mostly of symlinks, would trigger that new detection for every single
unit in /etc/systemd/system. The reason for that is that the units
directory itself is already a symlink.
