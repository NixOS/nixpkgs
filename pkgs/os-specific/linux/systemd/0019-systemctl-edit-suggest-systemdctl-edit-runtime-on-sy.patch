Subject: [PATCH] systemctl-edit: suggest `systemdctl edit --runtime` on system
 scope

This is a NixOS-specific change. When trying to modify a unit with
`systemctl edit` on NixOS, it'll fail with "Read-only file system":

    $ systemctl edit libvirtd
    Failed to open "/etc/systemd/system/libvirtd.service.d/.#override.conffa9825a0c9a249eb": Read-only file system

This is because `/etc/systemd/system` is a symlink into the store. In
fact, I'd consider this a feature rather than a bug since this ensures I
don't introduce state imperatively.

However, people wrongly assume that it's not possible to edit units
ad-hoc and re-deploy their system for quick&dirty debugging where this
would be absolutely fine (and doable with `--runtime` which adds a
transient and non-persistent unit override in `/run`).

To make sure that people learn about it quicker, this patch
throws an error which suggests using `--runtime` when running
`systemctl edit` on the system scope.

For the user scope this isn't needed because user-level unit overrides
are written into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user`.
