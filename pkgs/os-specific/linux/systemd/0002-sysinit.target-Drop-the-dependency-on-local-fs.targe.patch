Subject: [PATCH 02/24] sysinit.target: Drop the dependency on local-fs.target
 and swap.target

Having all services with DefaultDependencies=yes depend on
local-fs.target is annoying, because some of those services might be
necessary to mount local filesystems.  For instance, Charon's
send-keys feature requires sshd to be running in order to receive LUKS
encryption keys, which in turn requires dhcpcd, and so on.  So we drop
this dependency (and swap.target as well for consistency).  If
services require a specific mount, they should use RequiresMountsFor
in any case.
