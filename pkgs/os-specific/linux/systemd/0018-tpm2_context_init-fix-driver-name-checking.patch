Subject: [PATCH] tpm2_context_init: fix driver name checking

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/542dbc623e introduced
additional checks for tpm2 driver names, namely ensuring the driver
name, when concated with "libtss2-tcti-" and ".so.0", generates a valid
filename (with no '/' inside).

For example, if the driver is name "device", the line
  fn = strjoina("libtss2-tcti-", driver, ".so.0")
would yield "libtss2-tcti-device.so.0", passing the check. And the
filename is then passed to dlopen for loading the driver.

Our current approach for systemd to correctly locate these dynamically
loaded libraries is to patch the filenames to include their absolute
path. Thus the line mentioned above is patched into
  fn = strjoina("/nix/store/xxxxxxx-tpm2-tss-3.2.0/lib/libtss2-tcti-", driver, ".so.0")
yielding "/nix/store/xxxxxxx-tpm2-tss-3.2.0/lib/libtss2-tcti-device.so.0",
tripping the check.

This patch relaxes the check to also accept absolute paths, by replacing
filename_is_valid with path_is_valid.
