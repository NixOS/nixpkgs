Subject: [PATCH 13/19] add rootprefix to lookup dir paths

systemd does not longer use the UDEVLIBEXEC directory as root for
discovery default udev rules. By adding `$out/lib` to the lookup paths
we should again be able to discover the udev rules amongst other default
files that I might have missed.
