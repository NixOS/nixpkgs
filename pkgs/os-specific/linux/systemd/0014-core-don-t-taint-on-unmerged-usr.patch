Subject: [PATCH] core: don't taint on unmerged /usr

NixOS has very different approach towards /bin and /sbin - they don't
really exist (except for /bin/sh and /usr/bin/env, because these are used
heavily in shebangs around the world). The concept of merged or unmerged
usr doesn't really apply here at all, it's neither of the two.
Users don't execute things from /bin or /sbin, there's nothing else in
there. In all cases, systemd doesn't look things up from /usr/bin or /bin,
so showing the taint isn't really helpful.
