  # The Ubuntu package creates a number of state/config directories upon
  # installation, and so the fanctl script expects those directories to exist
  # before being used. Instead, we patch the fanctl script to gracefully handle
  # the fact that the directories might not exist yet.
  # Also, when dnsmasq is given --conf-file="", it will still attempt to read
  # /etc/dnsmasq.conf; if that file does not exist, dnsmasq subsequently fails,
  # so we'll use /dev/null, which actually works as intended.
