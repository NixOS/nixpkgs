      pagemon is an ncurses based interactive memory/page monitoring tool
      allowing one to browse the memory map of an active running process
      on Linux.
      pagemon reads the PTEs of a given process and display the soft/dirty
      activity in real time. The tool identifies the type of memory mapping
      a page belongs to, so one can easily scan through memory looking at
      pages of memory belonging data, code, heap, stack, anonymous mappings
      or even swapped-out pages.
