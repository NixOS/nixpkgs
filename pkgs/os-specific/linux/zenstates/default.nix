# Zenstates provides access to a variety of CPU tunables no Ryzen processors.
#
# In particular, I am adding Zenstates because I need it to disable the C6
# sleep state to stabilize wake from sleep on my Lenovo x395 system. After
# installing Zenstates, I need a before-sleep script like so:
#
# before-sleep = pkgs.writeScript "before-sleep" ''
#   #!${pkgs.bash}/bin/bash
#   ${pkgs.zenstates}/bin/zenstates --c6-disable
# '';
#
# ...
#
# systemd.services.before-sleep = {
#     description = "Jobs to run before going to sleep";
#     serviceConfig = {
#       Type = "oneshot";
#       ExecStart = "${before-sleep}";
#     };
#     wantedBy = [ "sleep.target" ];
#     before = [ "sleep.target" ];
#   };
