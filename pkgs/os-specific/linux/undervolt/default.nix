      Undervolt is a program for undervolting Intel CPUs under Linux. It works in a similar
      manner to the Windows program ThrottleStop (i.e, MSR 0x150). You can apply a fixed
      voltage offset to one of 5 voltage planes, and override your systems temperature
      target (CPU will throttle when this temperature is reached).
