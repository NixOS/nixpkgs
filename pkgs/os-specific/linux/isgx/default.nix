      The linux-sgx-driver project (isgx) hosts an out-of-tree driver
      for the Linux* Intel(R) SGX software stack, which would be used
      until the driver upstreaming process is complete (before 5.11.0).

      It is used to support Enhanced Privacy Identification (EPID)
      based attestation on the platforms without Flexible Launch Control.
