      fatrace reports file access events from all running processes.
      Its main purpose is to find processes which keep waking up the disk
      unnecessarily and thus prevent some power saving.
      Requires a Linux kernel with the FANOTIFY configuration option enabled.
      Enabling X86_MSR is also recommended for power-usage-report on x86.
