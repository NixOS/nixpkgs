Subject: [PATCH 1/2] No impure bin sh

default_shell is used to populuate default shell used to execute jobs.
Unless SHELL is set to a different value this would be /bin/sh.
Our stdenv provides sh in form of bash anyway. Having this value not
hard-coded has some advantages:

- It would ensure that on all systems it uses sh from its PATH rather
  than /bin/sh, which helps as different systems might have different
  shells there (bash vs. dash)
- In the past I had issues with LD_PRELOAD with BEAR, where /bin/sh
  used a different glibc than BEAR which came from my development shell.
