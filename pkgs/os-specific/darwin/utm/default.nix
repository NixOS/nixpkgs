      Features:
        - Full system emulation (MMU, devices, etc) using QEMU
        - 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V
        - VGA graphics mode using SPICE and QXL
        - Text terminal mode
        - USB devices
        - JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG
        - Frontend designed from scratch for macOS 11 and iOS 11+ using the
          latest and greatest APIs
        - Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device
        - Hardware accelerated virtualization using Hypervisor.framework and
          QEMU
        - Boot macOS guests with Virtualization.framework on macOS 12+
