      duti is a command-line utility capable of setting default applications for
      various document types on Mac OS X, using Apple's Uniform Type Identifiers. A
      UTI is a unique string describing the format of a file's content. For instance,
      a Microsoft Word document has a UTI of com.microsoft.word.doc. Using duti, the
      user can change which application acts as the default handler for a given UTI.
