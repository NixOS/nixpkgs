    ./0005-Fix-framework-installation-path.patch
    # Build a framework that matches the contents of the system CoreFoundation. This patch adds
    # versioning and drops the prefix and suffix, so the dynamic library is named `CoreFoundation`
    # instead of `libCoreFoundation.dylib`.

    # Link against the nixpkgs ICU instead of using Apple’s vendored version.
    ./0007-Use-nixpkgs-icu.patch
    # Don’t link against libcurl. This breaks a cycle between CF and curl, which depends on CF and
    # uses the SystemConfiguration framework to support NAT64.
    # This is safe because the symbols provided in CFURLSessionInterface are not provided by the
    # system CoreFoundation. They are meant to be used by the implementation of `NSURLSession` in
    # swift-corelibs-foundation, which is not built because it is not fully compatible with the
    # system Foundation used on Darwin.
