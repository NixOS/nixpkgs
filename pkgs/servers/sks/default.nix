      SKS is an OpenPGP keyserver whose goal is to provide easy to deploy,
      decentralized, and highly reliable synchronization. That means that a key
      submitted to one SKS server will quickly be distributed to all key
      servers, and even wildly out-of-date servers, or servers that experience
      spotty connectivity, can fully synchronize with rest of the system.
