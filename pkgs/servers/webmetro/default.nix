    longDescription = ''
    Webmetro is a simple relay server for broadcasting a WebM stream
    from one uploader to many downloaders, via HTTP.
    The initialization segment is remembered, so that viewers can join
    mid-stream.  Cluster timestamps are rewritten to be monotonic, so multiple
    (compatibly-encoded) webm files can be chained together without
    clients needing to reconnect.
