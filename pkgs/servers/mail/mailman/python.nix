        This overlay can be used whenever we need to override
        dependencies specific to the mailman ecosystem: in the past
        this was necessary for e.g. psycopg2[1] or sqlalchemy[2].

        In such a large ecosystem this sort of issue is expected
        to arise again. Since we don't want to clutter the python package-set
        itself with version overrides and don't want to change the APIs
        in here back and forth every time this comes up (and as a result
        force users to change their code accordingly), this overlay
        is kept on purpose, even when empty.
