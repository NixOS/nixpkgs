  # own prepared version of ''etc'' and ''var'' and also uses the prefix path (configure phase)
  # for hardcoded absolute references to its own binary farm, e.g. sendmail binary is
  # calling nullmailer-inject binary. Since we can't configure inside the store of
  # the derivation we need both directories in the root, but don't want to put them there
  # during install, hence we have to fix mumbling inside the install directory.
  # This is kind of a hack, but the only way I know of, yet.
