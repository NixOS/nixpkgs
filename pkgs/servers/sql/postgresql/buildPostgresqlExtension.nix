# PostgreSQL's build system for extensions (PGXS) makes the following assumptions:
# - All extensions will be installed in the same prefix as PostgreSQL itself.
# - pg_config is able to return the correct paths for bindir/libdir/datadir etc.
#
# Both of those assumptions break with nix. Since each extension is a separate
# derivation, we need to put all its files into a different folder. At the same
# time, pg_config only points to the PostgreSQL derivation's paths.
#
# When building extensions, the paths provided by pg_config are used for two
# purposes:
# - To find postgres libs and headers and reference those paths via -L and -I flags.
# - To determine the correct install directory.
#
# The PGXS Makefiles also support an environment variable DESTDIR, which is added as
# a prefix to all install locations. This is primarily used for temporary installs
# while running the test suite. Since pg_config returns absolute paths to /nix/store
# for us, using DESTDIR will result in install locations of the form:
#   $DESTIDR/nix/store/<postgresql-output>/...
#
# In multiple iterations, the following approaches have been tried to work around all
# of this:
# 1. For a long time, all extensions in nixpkgs just overwrote the installPhase
#    and moved the respective files to the correct location manually. This approach
#    is not maintainable, because whenever upstream adds a new file, we'd have to
#    make sure the file is correctly installed as well. Additionally, it makes adding
#    a new extension harder than it should be.
#
# 2. A wrapper around pg_config could just replace the returned paths with paths to
#    $out of currently building derivation, i.e. the extension. This works for install-
#    ation, but breaks for any of the libs and headers the extension needs from postgres
#    itself.
#
# 3. A variation of 2., but make the pg_config wrapper only return the changed paths
#    during the installPahse. During configure and build, it would return the regular
#    paths to the PostgreSQL derivation. This works better, but not for every case.
#    Some extensions try to be smarter and search for the "postgres" binary to deduce
#    the necessary paths from that. Those would still need special handling.
#
# 4. Use the fact that DESTDIR is prepended to every installation directory - and only
#    there, to run a replacement of all Makefiles in postgres' lib/pgxs/ folder and
#    all Makefiles in the extension's source. "$DESTDIR/$bindir" can be replaced with
#    "$out/bin" etc. - thus mapping the installPhase directly into the right output.
#    This works beautifully - for the majority of cases. But it doesn't work for
#    some extensions that use CMake. And it doesn't work for some extensions that use
#    custom variables instead of the default "bindir" and friends.
#
# 5. Just set DESTDIR to the extensions's output and then clean up afterward. This will
#    result in paths like this:
#      /nix/store/<extension-output>/nix/store/<postgresql-output>/...
#    Directly after the installPhase, we'll move the files in the right folder.
#    This seems to work consistently across all extensions we have in nixpkgs right now.
#    Of course, it would break down for any extension that doesn't support DESTDIR -
#    but that just means PGXS is not used either, so that's OK.
#
# This last approach is the one we're taking in this file. To make sure the removal of the
# nested nix/store happens immediately after the installPhase, before any other postInstall
# hooks run, this needs to be run in an override of `mkDerivation` and not in a setup hook.
