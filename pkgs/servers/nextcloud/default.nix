    Nextcloud v25 has been removed from `nixpkgs` as the support for is dropped
    by upstream in 2023-10. Please upgrade to at least Nextcloud v26 by declaring

        services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud26;

    in your NixOS config.

    WARNING: if you were on Nextcloud 24 you have to upgrade to Nextcloud 25
    first on 23.05 because Nextcloud doesn't support upgrades across multiple major versions!
