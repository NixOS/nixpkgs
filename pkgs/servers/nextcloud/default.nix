    Nextcloud v20 has been removed from `nixpkgs` as the support for it was dropped
    by upstream in 2021-10. Please upgrade to at least Nextcloud v21 by declaring

        services.nextcloud.package = pkgs.nextcloud21;

    in your NixOS config.

    WARNING: if you were on Nextcloud 19 on NixOS 21.05 you have to upgrade to Nextcloud 20
    first on 21.05 because Nextcloud doesn't support upgrades accross multiple major versions!
