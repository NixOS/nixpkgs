Subject: [PATCH] Setup: remove custom dbuser creation behavior

Both PostgreSQL and MySQL can be authenticated against from Nextcloud by
supplying a database password. Now, during setup the following things
happen:

* When using postgres and the db user has elevated permissions, a new
  unprivileged db user is created and the settings `dbuser`/`dbpass` are
  altered in `config.php`.

* When using MySQL, the password is **always** regenerated since
  24.0.5/23.0.9[1].

I consider both cases problematic: the reason why people do configuration
management is to have it as single source of truth! So, IMHO any
application that silently alters config and thus causes deployed
nodes to diverge from the configuration is harmful for that.

I guess it was sheer luck that it worked for so long in NixOS because
nobody has apparently used password authentication with a privileged
user to operate Nextcloud (which is a good thing in fact).
