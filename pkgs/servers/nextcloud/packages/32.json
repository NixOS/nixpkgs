    "description": "# Nextcloud Cospend 💰\n\nNextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).\n\nYou can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share expenses with a group of people.\n\nIt lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. Balances are not an absolute amount of money at members disposal but rather a relative information showing if a member has spent more for the group than the group has spent for her/him, independently of exactly who spent money for whom. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.\n\nProject members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be shared with other Nextcloud users or via public links.\n\n[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).\n\n[PayForMe](https://github.com/mayflower/PayForMe) iOS client is currently under developpement!\n\nThe private and public APIs are documented using [the Nextcloud OpenAPI extractor](https://github.com/nextcloud/openapi-extractor/). This documentation can be accessed directly in Nextcloud.

So clients have to periodically ask the server for changes. This causes unnecessary delays and battery usage.\n\nThe WebDAV-Push standard, which is currently in development, wants to solve this problem with an open protocol, too.\n\nThis is the server part of these efforts to draft a standard and provide a working implementation (server + client) in order to demonstrate it.\n\n\nThe current WebDAV-Push draft is provided by [@bitfireAT](https://github.com/bitfireAT).\n          \nThis Nextcloud extension has been developed by [@verdigado](https://github.com/verdigado).",

Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n* 📍 Display location history\n* ⛛ Filter points\n* ✎ Manually edit/add/delete points\n* ✎ Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n* ⛶ Define geofencing zones for devices\n* ⚇ Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n* 🖧 Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n* 🔗 Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n* 🖫 Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n* 🗠 Display sessions statistics\n* 🔒 [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n* 🗓 Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n* ◔ Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated.

    "description": "# Social Login\n\nMake it possible to create users and log in via Telegram, OAuth, or OpenID.\n\nFor OAuth, you must create an app with certain providers. Login buttons will appear on the login page if an app ID is specified. Settings are located in the \"Social login\" section of the settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLog in to your Nextcloud installation as an administrator. Under \"Apps\", click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC Groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For this, specify the \"Groups claim\" in the custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. This claim should be returned from the provider in the `id_token` or at the user info endpoint. The format should be an `array` or a comma-separated string. E.g., (with a claim named `roles`):\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\n```\nor\n```json\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nNested claims are also supported. For example, `resource_access.client-id.roles` for:\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\n**DisplayName** support is also available:\n```json\n{\"roles\": [{\"gid\": 1, \"displayName\": \"admin\"}, {\"gid\": 2, \"displayName\": \"user\"}]}\n```\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing Nextcloud groups.\n2. Create provider groups in Nextcloud and associate them with users (if the appropriate option is enabled).\n\nTo sync groups on every login, ensure the \"Update user profile every login\" setting is checked.\n\n## Examples for Groups\n\n* Configure WSO2IS to return a roles claim with OIDC [here](https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff).\n* [GitLab OIDC configuration to allow specific GitLab groups](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md).\n\n## Built-in OAuth Providers\n\nCopy the link from a specific login button to get the correct \"redirect URL\" for OAuth app settings.\n\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Apple](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/apple.md)\n* [Codeberg](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/codeberg.md)\n* [Discord](#configure-discord)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [GitLab](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md)\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Keycloak](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/keycloak.md)\n* [Mail.ru](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/mailru.md)\n* **PlexTv**: Use any title as the app ID.\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n\nFor details about Google's \"Allow login only from specified domain\" setting, see [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44). Use a comma-separated list for multiple domains.\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd `'social_login_auto_redirect' => true` to `config.php` to automatically redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured. To temporarily disable this (e.g., for local admin login), add `noredir=1` to the login URL: `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`.\n\nConfigure HTTP client options using:\n```php\n  'social_login_http_client' => [\n    'timeout' => 45,\n    'proxy' => 'socks4://127.0.0.1:9050', // See <https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html> for allowed formats\n  ],\n```\nin `config.php`.\n\n### Configure a Provider via CLI\n\nUse the `occ` utility to configure providers via the command line. Replace variables and URLs with your deployment values:\n```bash\nphp occ config:app:set sociallogin custom_providers --value='{\"custom_oidc\": [{\"name\": \"gitlab_oidc\", \"title\": \"Gitlab\", \"authorizeUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/authorize\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/token\", \"userInfoUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/userinfo\", \"logoutUrl\": \"\", \"clientId\": \"$my_application_id\", \"clientSecret\": \"$my_super_secret_secret\", \"scope\": \"openid\", \"groupsClaim\": \"groups\", \"style\": \"gitlab\", \"defaultGroup\": \"\"}]}'\n```\nFor Docker, prepend `docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME` to the command or run interactively via `docker exec -it -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME sh`.\n\nTo inspect configurations:\n```sql\nmysql -u nextcloud -p nextcloud\nPassword: <yourpassword>\n\n> SELECT * FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid='sociallogin';\n```\nOr run:\n```bash\ndocker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME php occ config:app:get sociallogin custom_providers\n```\n\n### Configure Discord\n\n1. Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\n2. Navigate to `Settings > OAuth2 > General`. Add a redirect URL: `https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/apps/sociallogin/oauth/discord`.\n3. Copy the `CLIENT ID` and generate a `CLIENT SECRET`.\n4. In Nextcloud, go to `Settings > Social Login`. Paste the `CLIENT ID` into \"App id\" and `CLIENT SECRET` into \"Secret\".\n5. Select a default group for new users.\n6. For group mapping, see [#395](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/pull/395).\n\n## Hint\n\n### Callback (Reply) URL\nCopy the link from a login button on the Nextcloud login page and use it as the callback URL on your provider's site. To make the button visible temporarily, fill provider settings with placeholder data and update later.\n\nIf you encounter callback URL errors despite correct settings, ensure your Nextcloud server generates HTTPS URLs by adding `'overwriteprotocol' => 'https'` to `config.php`.",
