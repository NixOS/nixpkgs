    "description": "# Nextcloud Cospend üí∞\n\nNextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).\n\nYou can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share expenses with a group of people.\n\nIt lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. Balances are not an absolute amount of money at members disposal but rather a relative information showing if a member has spent more for the group than the group has spent for her/him, independently of exactly who spent money for whom. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.\n\nProject members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be shared with other Nextcloud users or via public links.\n\n[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).\n\n[PayForMe](https://github.com/mayflower/PayForMe) iOS client is currently under developpement!\n\nThe private and public APIs are documented using [the Nextcloud OpenAPI extractor](https://github.com/nextcloud/openapi-extractor/).

The signer's identity and approval is linked to the file contents and a timestamp by cryptographic means. The signing time and the document's integrity can be verified to ensure that the document has not been tampered with after signing.\n\n**Simple Electronic Signature** - the simplest kind of electronic signature. eID Easy sends a unique link to the signer's e-mail. The signer opens the link, reviews the file and confirms their approval. A visual signature is added to the file. eId Easy adds a cryptographic e-seal to the file, to ensure that it cannot be modified after signing.\n\n# Pricing\nThe minimum fee is 20 EUR per month +VAT, which includes signatures up to that amount.\nSee [https://eideasy.com/pricing](https://eideasy.com/pricing) for detailed pricing information.\n\n# Feedback is welcome\nAre you not seeing your preferred signature card / signing app / other QES method?

It works for publications formatted according to the following standards:\n\n - [EPUB]\n - [PDF]\n - [CBR and CBZ] ('comics')\n\nEPUB files are displayed using the futurepress [epub.js] renderer to provide near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.\n\nPDF is handled by Mozilla's [pdf.js] renderer in combination with a custom reader app to enable side-by-side display, batch search and more. Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app.\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [EPUB]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/devnoname120/epubviewer#readme",

    "description": "*Bring decentralized, sovereign cloud storage to Nextcloud with the HejBit Swarm plugin!*\n\nThis plugin integrates [Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org/) (a decentralized, blockchain-connected file storage system) directly into your [Nextcloud ](https://nextcloud.com/)instance.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- Dependencies\n- Setup and Installation\n- Usage\n  - Settings\n  - Using HejBit Swarm\n  - Additional Integration with Moodle\n- HejBit Free Trial\n- License\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBefore using the plugin, ensure you have the following:\n\n- An active Nextcloud instance (version 30 or 31)\n- A valid Access Key and URL to activate the service\n  - [Get Your Free Trial for the Nextcloud Swarm Plugin](https://metaprovide.org/hejbit/start)\n\n## Setup and Installation\n\nFollow these steps to configure HejBit Swarm in Nextcloud:\n\n1. Ensure the **External Storage** plugin is enabled.\n2. Install the **External Storage: HejBit Swarm** app from the Nextcloud App Store.\n3. Navigate to External Storage Administration: Profile menu -> Settings -> External Storage.\n4. Create a new external storage with a folder name of your choice and select *'HejBit-Swarm'* as the storage type. Then, enter the Access Key and URL configuration.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, HejBit integrates Swarm directly with Nextcloud‚Äôs \"Files\" section, allowing seamless file operations:\n\n- **Upload:** Transfer files to decentralized storage.\n- **Download/View:** Retrieve and view files from decentralized storage.\n- **Copy/Move:** Shift files between any external storage and decentralized storage.\n- **Rename:** Change file names as needed.\n- **Archive/Restore:** Manage your files by archiving or restoring them.\n- **Hide/Show:** Control the visibility of files in your storage.\n- **View Swarm Reference:** Access the unique Swarm reference for each file.\n- **Export all Swarm References:** Backup all your Swarm references easily.\n\nAdditionally, we have introduced a HejBit Feedback button that appears in the bottom left corner when you are inside a HejBit folder. This feature allows users to easily send feedback regarding general inquiries, ideas, or issues directly from the plugin.\n\n### Settings\n\nUsers with administrative credentials can configure the plugin through the standard External Storage settings. Here, you can input your Access Key and URL for HejBit.\n\n### Using HejBit Swarm\n\nOnce setup and configured, the Decentralized Storage is ready to use.\n\n- Access the Decentralized Storage folder under \"All Files\" or via the \"Files\" menu under \"External Storage.\"\n- Once uploaded, it can be viewed internally or downloaded. It can also be copied to another storage.\n- Files from another Nextcloud storage can also be copied/moved to the decentralized storage. Choose the decentralized storage folder as the target Folder.\n- To access a file's Swarm reference (its unique swarm network address), you have two options: right-click directly on the file and select the reference option, or use the three-dot Actions menu and choose 'View Swarm Reference.' Both methods will display the hash, which you can then copy to your clipboard for sharing or future access.\n- To effectively organize your files, you can utilize the Archive and Restore features for both folders and individual files, allowing for better management of your storage.\n- For a comprehensive backup of all your Swarm hashes, you can easily export all Swarm references directly from the menu located in the root HejBit Swarm folder.\n- We encourage you to share your thoughts and experiences with us! A **HejBit Feedback** button is conveniently located in the bottom left corner when you are inside a HejBit folder. This feature allows you to provide feedback on any inquiries, suggestions, or issues you may encounter, helping us enhance your experience and improve the plugin for all users.\n\n\n\n\n### Additional Integration with Moodle\n\nYou can also enhance your experience by integrating the HejBit Swarm plugin with the **Moodle Nextcloud plugin**. This integration allows users to access decentralized storage directly within the Moodle environment, providing a seamless experience for educational content management. For more information on how to set up this integration, visit the [Moodle Nextcloud repository documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Nextcloud_repository).\n\nFor detailed guidance on using the integrated features, please refer to the [Metaprovide Learning Platform](https://learning.metaprovide.org/login/index.php).\n\n## HejBit Free Trial\n\nExperience the future of data storage with 5GB of free, decentralized storage on the Ethereum Swarm network. This offer is available as a 14-day free trial, allowing you to explore the capabilities of our plugin without any commitment. HejBit seamlessly integrates with your existing Nextcloud interface, providing true data sovereignty without the complexity. Enjoy the benefits of decentralized storage and take control of your data today!\n[Get your Free Trial here!](https://metaprovide.org/hejbit/start)\n\n## License\n\nThis program is licensed under the AGPLv3 or later.",

Enabling it is a bad idea and we do not recommend this at all.\nAlthough security features like sandboxing, CSP and CORS limit what can be done, it still means that unknown code is being executed within Nextcloud.\n\nIf you still wish to enable JS, this occ command will enable it:\n```bash\n./occ config:app:set htmlviewer allowJs --value=1\n```\n\n### File Size Limit\nBy default, the app will load HTML files up to 32MB. To change the file size, use this occ command:\n```bash\n ./occ config:app:set htmlviewer maxSize --value=SizeInMegabyte\n```\n\n### Iframe Permissions\nThe app automatically configures the iframe with an CSP for [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmliframeelement_csp) and a sandbox to limit code execution and data access.\nBoth policies can be changed through config settings with the OCC commands shown below.\nPlease be aware that the general CSP of your Nextcloud may still block some access regardless of what CSP and sandbox settings you configure.\n\nTo change the CSP or sandbox settings, use these occ commands:\n```bash\n ./occ config:app:set htmlviewer csp --value=CustomCspSettings\n ./occ config:app:set htmlviewer sandbox --value=CustomSandboxSettings\n```",

    "description": "# PhoneTrack Nextcloud application\n\nüì± PhoneTrack is a Nextcloud application to track and store mobile device's locations.\n\nüó∫ It receives information from mobile phone's logging apps and displays it dynamically on a map.\n\nüåç Help us to translate this app on [PhoneTrack Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/phonetrack).\n\n‚öí Check out other ways to help in the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nHow to use PhoneTrack :\n\n* Create a tracking session.\n* Give the logging link\\* to the mobile devices. Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n* üìç Display location history\n* ‚õõ Filter points\n* ‚úé Manually edit/add/delete points\n* ‚úé Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n* ‚õ∂ Define geofencing zones for devices\n* ‚öá Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n* üñß Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n* üîó Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n* üñ´ Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n* üó† Display sessions statistics\n* üîí [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n* üóì Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n* ‚óî Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

This is ```www-data``` on Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives, `wwwrun` on SUSE based distributions, `apache` on Red Hat/Fedora and `http` on Arch linux and derivatives.\n\nUpdates can be done like this:\n```\nsudo -u wwwrun php -d memory_limit=512M ./occ app:update --all\n```\n\nOf course, alternatively you could increase memory usage and PHP time-outs by default, see the [Nextcloud documentation.](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/big_file_upload_configuration.html?highlight=php%20timeout#configuring-your-web-server)\n\nAdditional troubleshooting tips can be found [here](https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/richdocumentscode?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting).",

It can be used in conjunction \nwith Asterisk, to benefit from the control, autonomy and advanced PBX features offered by Asterisk, or without \nAsterisk, if it's connected directly to the SIP provider. For calls to and from regular phone numbers, a SIP \nprovider like Telnyx or Localphone is needed and a real phone number acquired from that provider. If Asterisk is \nused, it's recommended to be Asterisk version 18.0.0 LTS and it has to be installed on a VPS or dedicated server, \nas explained in the 'Admin documentation' linked on this page. The web server has to be configured to allow access \nto a specific directory and to proxy WebSocket traffic to a specific URL, as explained in the 'Admin documentation'. \nNot all SIP providers allow connections from external Asterisk servers or direct connections from web applications \nthat use SIP over WebSocket, like SIP Trip Phone. Thus, you can connect this application to Telnyx, Localphone, \nTwilio, Flowroute, Vonage, etc. via an Asterisk server, but if you want to connect it directly to the SIP provider, \nfrom the 5 mentioned providers, only Telnyx will work, because the others don't allow direct connections from web \napplications using SIP over WebSocket.\nSIP Trip Phone is based on the ctxSip phone.\n\n### Features:\n\n* üìû SIP Trip Phone allows making and receiving calls to/from any mobile or landline phone at lower rates than with regular phones. It is known that VoIP phone calls are up to 70% cheaper than regular phone calls. International VoIP phone calls can cost even 90% less than regular phone calls.\n\n* üåê You can acquire phone numbers in countries of your choice and make cheap international phone calls to receivers in those countries. When calling you back on those numbers, the receivers will pay as for local calls.\n\n* üÜì If Asterisk is used, you can make free calls over the Internet between extensions configured on the underlying Asterisk server.\n\n* ‚òéÔ∏è SIP Trip Phone logs recent phone calls and their duration and allows holding, muting and transferring phone calls.\n\n* üìë When using Asterisk, SIP Trip Phone allows choosing any available phone number as the 'From' number for outgoing calls.\n\n* üìã SIP Trip Phone lists all the contacts and Nextcloud users with available phone numbers, so that you can call them with one click.\n\n* üì• Phone conversations can be easily recorded and saved as webm/ogx files. An audio warning can be played before each recording.\n\n* üö© Incoming calls are signaled by on-screen notifications.\n\n* üìÉ Once you open SIP Trip Phone, you can use it even if you are logged out of Nextcloud.\n\n* üíª If Asterisk is used, on the underlying Asterisk server you can implement an IVR (Interactive Voice Response or 'voice menu') and many advanced PBX features such as voicemail, queue management, music on hold, number blacklisting, call recording, audio conference calls, etc.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for a phone number. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low per minute prices: if Asterisk is used, you can make calls within the US starting from $0.0050 per minute and receive calls with $0.0075 per minute or less (Telnyx), or $0.0060 per minute for outgoing calls and $0 for incoming calls (Localphone).\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Localphone, Twilio, Flowroute or Vonage.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sip-trip-phone)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

The time interval between two consecutive messages is configurable.\n\n* üë§ The Display Name of Nextcloud users can be prepended to their messages, to make the origin of messages clearer.\n\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è  Admins can restrict the use of specific phone numbers to specific groups or users.\n\n* ‚úâÔ∏è  Auto-replies in 'daily mode' and 'vacation mode' can be configured for any controlled phone number.\n\n* üîè SMS/MMS messages coming from Telnyx, Plivo and Twilio are checked for authenticity by verifying the SMS provider's signature.\n\n* üìß Users receive notifications in Nextcloud and (optionally) emails when new SMS/MMS messages arrive.\n\n* üìÑ Each sent message receives a delivery receipt displayed in the Sent SMS Messages table.\n\n* üéé Messages exchanged between pairs of numbers are organized into conversations on a separate page where each conversation can be viewed, tagged and archived.\n\n* üìû It can be used with regular 'long code' (10-digit) phone numbers, but also with 'toll-free' numbers and 'short codes'. Users see a list with their current phone numbers and can set them as Sender IDs. Setting alphanumeric Sender IDs is also possible.\n\n* üì± If Nextcloud is accessed in Firefox for mobile (version 123.0 or newer), it can be used directly on mobile devices.\n\n* üíµ It allows checking the current Telnyx/Plivo/Twilio balance by selecting the provider on the left panel.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for an SMS/MMS enabled phone number located in a country chosen by the user. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low prices per SMS: starting from $0.0040 per sent message and $0.0040 per received message (Telnyx), or $0.0085 per sent message and $0.0085 per received message (Plivo), or $0.0109 per sent message and 0.0079 per received message (Twilio), or $0.0055 per sent message and 0.0040 per received message (Flowroute) in the USA.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Plivo, Twilio or Flowroute.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sms-relentless)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

    "description": "# Social Login\n\nMake it possible to create users and log in via Telegram, OAuth, or OpenID.\n\nFor OAuth, you must create an app with certain providers. Login buttons will appear on the login page if an app ID is specified. Settings are located in the \"Social login\" section of the settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLog in to your Nextcloud installation as an administrator. Under \"Apps\", click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC Groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For this, specify the \"Groups claim\" in the custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. This claim should be returned from the provider in the `id_token` or at the user info endpoint. The format should be an `array` or a comma-separated string. E.g., (with a claim named `roles`):\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\n```\nor\n```json\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nNested claims are also supported. For example, `resource_access.client-id.roles` for:\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\n**DisplayName** support is also available:\n```json\n{\"roles\": [{\"gid\": 1, \"displayName\": \"admin\"}, {\"gid\": 2, \"displayName\": \"user\"}]}\n```\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing Nextcloud groups.\n2. Create provider groups in Nextcloud and associate them with users (if the appropriate option is enabled).\n\nTo sync groups on every login, ensure the \"Update user profile every login\" setting is checked.\n\n## Examples for Groups\n\n* Configure WSO2IS to return a roles claim with OIDC [here](https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff).\n* [GitLab OIDC configuration to allow specific GitLab groups](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md).\n\n## Built-in OAuth Providers\n\nCopy the link from a specific login button to get the correct \"redirect URL\" for OAuth app settings.\n\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Apple](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/apple.md)\n* [Codeberg](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/codeberg.md)\n* [Discord](#configure-discord)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [GitLab](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md)\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Keycloak](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/keycloak.md)\n* [Mail.ru](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/mailru.md)\n* **PlexTv**: Use any title as the app ID.\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n\nFor details about Google's \"Allow login only from specified domain\" setting, see [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44). Use a comma-separated list for multiple domains.\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd `'social_login_auto_redirect' => true` to `config.php` to automatically redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured. To temporarily disable this (e.g., for local admin login), add `noredir=1` to the login URL: `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`.\n\nConfigure HTTP client options using:\n```php\n  'social_login_http_client' => [\n    'timeout' => 45,\n    'proxy' => 'socks4://127.0.0.1:9050', // See <https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html> for allowed formats\n  ],\n```\nin `config.php`.\n\n### Configure a Provider via CLI\n\nUse the `occ` utility to configure providers via the command line. Replace variables and URLs with your deployment values:\n```bash\nphp occ config:app:set sociallogin custom_providers --value='{\"custom_oidc\": [{\"name\": \"gitlab_oidc\", \"title\": \"Gitlab\", \"authorizeUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/authorize\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/token\", \"userInfoUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/userinfo\", \"logoutUrl\": \"\", \"clientId\": \"$my_application_id\", \"clientSecret\": \"$my_super_secret_secret\", \"scope\": \"openid\", \"groupsClaim\": \"groups\", \"style\": \"gitlab\", \"defaultGroup\": \"\"}]}'\n```\nFor Docker, prepend `docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME` to the command or run interactively via `docker exec -it -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME sh`.\n\nTo inspect configurations:\n```sql\nmysql -u nextcloud -p nextcloud\nPassword: <yourpassword>\n\n> SELECT * FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid='sociallogin';\n```\nOr run:\n```bash\ndocker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME php occ config:app:get sociallogin custom_providers\n```\n\n### Configure Discord\n\n1. Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\n2. Navigate to `Settings > OAuth2 > General`. Add a redirect URL: `https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/apps/sociallogin/oauth/discord`.\n3. Copy the `CLIENT ID` and generate a `CLIENT SECRET`.\n4. In Nextcloud, go to `Settings > Social Login`. Paste the `CLIENT ID` into \"App id\" and `CLIENT SECRET` into \"Secret\".\n5. Select a default group for new users.\n6. For group mapping, see [#395](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/pull/395).\n\n## Hint\n\n### Callback (Reply) URL\nCopy the link from a login button on the Nextcloud login page and use it as the callback URL on your provider's site. To make the button visible temporarily, fill provider settings with placeholder data and update later.\n\nIf you encounter callback URL errors despite correct settings, ensure your Nextcloud server generates HTTPS URLs by adding `'overwriteprotocol' => 'https'` to `config.php`.",

Or filter for tasks in the Reports or Timeline view to display total or aggregated values.\n\nThis app is still under development, so stay tuned for updates and additional features! If you have any suggestions, bug reports or feature requests, feel free to head over to our [GitHub project page](https://github.com/mtierltd/timetracker) and search through the existing issues, maybe your topic is already under discussion!
