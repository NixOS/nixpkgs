    "description": "Once enabled, a new Tasks menu will appear in your Nextcloud apps menu. From there you can add and delete tasks, edit their title, description, start and due dates and mark them as important. Tasks can be shared between users. Tasks can be synchronized using CalDav (each task list is linked to an Nextcloud calendar, to sync it to your local client: Thunderbird, Evolution, KDE Kontact, iCal … - just add the calendar as a remote calendar in your client). You can download your tasks as ICS files using the download button for each calendar.",

In addition, you can use the Nextcloud LDAP user provider to keep the convenience for users. (e.g. when sharing)\nThe following providers are supported and tested at the moment:\n\n* **SAML 2.0**\n\t* OneLogin\n\t* Shibboleth\n\t* Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)\n\n* **Authentication via Environment Variable**\n\t* Kerberos (mod_auth_kerb)\n\t* Any other provider that authenticates using the environment variable\n\nWhile theoretically any other authentication provider implementing either one of those standards is compatible, we like to note that they are not part of any internal test matrix.",
