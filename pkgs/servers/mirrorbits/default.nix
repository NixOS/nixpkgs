      Mirrorbits is a geographical download redirector written in Go for
      distributing files efficiently across a set of mirrors. It offers
      a simple and economic way to create a Content Delivery Network
      layer using a pure software stack. It is primarily designed for
      the distribution of large-scale Open-Source projects with a lot
      of traffic.
