      Jitsi Videobridge is an XMPP server component that allows for multiuser video communication.
      Unlike the expensive dedicated hardware videobridges, Jitsi Videobridge does not mix the video
      channels into a composite video stream, but only relays the received video channels to all call
      participants. Therefore, while it does need to run on a server with good network bandwidth,
      CPU horsepower is not that critical for performance.
