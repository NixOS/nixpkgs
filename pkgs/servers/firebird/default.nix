  # Thus I think its best to trust firebird devs and use their version

  # icu version missmatch may cause such error when selecting from a table:

  # icu 3.0 can still be built easily by nix (by dropping the #elif case and
  # make | make)

/*
   there are 3 ways to use firebird:
   a) superserver
    - one process, one thread for each connection
   b) classic
    - is built by default
    - one process for each connection
    - on linux direct io operations (?)
   c) embedded.

   manual says that you usually don't notice the difference between a and b.

   I'm only interested in the embedder shared libary for now.
   So everything isn't tested yet
