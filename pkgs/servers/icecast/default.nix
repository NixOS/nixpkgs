    longDescription = ''
      Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports
      Ogg (Vorbis and Theora), Opus, WebM and MP3 audio streams.
      It can be used to create an Internet radio station or a privately
      running jukebox and many things in between. It is very versatile
      in that new formats can be added relatively easily and supports
      open standards for commuincation and interaction.
