      wallabag is a self hostable application for saving web pages.

      Point the environment variable $WALLABAG_DATA to a data directory that contains the folder `app/config` which must be a clone of wallabag's configuration files with your customized `parameters.yml`. These need to be updated every package upgrade.
      After a package upgrade, empty the `var/cache` folder.
