      wallabag is a self hostable application for saving web pages.

      To use, point the environment variable $WALLABAG_DATA to a directory called `app` that contains the folder `config` with wallabag's configuration files. These need to be updated every package upgrade. In `app`'s parent folder, a directory called `var` containing wallabag's data will be created.
      After a package upgrade, empty the `var/cache` folder.
