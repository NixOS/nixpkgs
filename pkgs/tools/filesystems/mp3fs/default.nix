      A read-only FUSE filesystem which transcodes between audio formats
      (currently only FLAC to MP3) on the fly when files are opened and read.
      It can let you use a FLAC collection with software and/or hardware
      which only understands the MP3 format, or transcode files through
      simple drag-and-drop in a file browser.
