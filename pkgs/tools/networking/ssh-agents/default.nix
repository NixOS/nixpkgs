    longDescription = ''
      The SSH agent is usually spawned by running eval $(ssh-agent), however this
      spawns a new SSH agent at every invocation. This project provides an
      ssh-agent wrapper called ssh-agents that is capable of spawning an SSH
      agent and caching the environment variables for later invocation.

      Features
      - One SSH agent across all terminals
      - Add all un-encrypted SSH keys to the agent upon spawning. Please note
        that encrypted SSH keys can only be added via ssh-add after having
        started the agent.
      - Ability to have different keys in different agents for security purposes.
      - Multiple SSH agents
      - To use multi-SSH agents, start ssh agent with the --name flag. The
        given name is expected to be a folder under ~/.ssh/name containing the
        keys to include in the agent.
