      In the author's words:

      I felt bothered because I never remember the long and tedious command
      line to setup my wifi interface. So, I wanted to develop something
      using rust to simplify the usage of nmcli, and I met the wifiscanner
      project that gave me almost everything I wanted to create this tool.
