        Info
        This was influenced by the old bwm util written by Barney (barney@freewill.tzo.com) which had some issues with faster interfaces and was very simple. Since i had almost all code done anyway for other projects, i decided to create my own version.

        I actually don't know if netstat input is useful at all. I saw this elsewhere, so i added it. Its target is "netstat 1.42 (2001-04-15)" linux or Free/Open/netBSD. If there are other formats i would be happy to add them.
