      Snabb Switch is a LuaJIT-based toolkit for writing high-speed
      packet networking code (such as routing, switching, firewalling,
      and so on). It includes both a scripting inteface for creating
      new applications and also some built-in applications that are
      ready to run.
      It is especially intended for ISPs and other network operators.
