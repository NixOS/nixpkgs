      aMule is an eMule-like client for the eD2k and Kademlia
      networks, supporting multiple platforms.  Currently aMule
      (officially) supports a wide variety of platforms and operating
      systems, being compatible with more than 60 different
      hardware+OS configurations.  aMule is entirely free, its
      sourcecode released under the GPL just like eMule, and includes
      no adware or spyware as is often found in proprietary P2P
      applications.
