      Pdsh is a high-performance, parallel remote shell utility. It has
      built-in, thread-safe clients for Berkeley and Kerberos V4 rsh and
      can call SSH externally (though with reduced performance). Pdsh
      uses a "sliding window" parallel algorithm to conserve socket
      resources on the initiating node and to allow progress to continue
      while timeouts occur on some connections.
