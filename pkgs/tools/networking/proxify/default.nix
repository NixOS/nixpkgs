      This tool supports multiple operations such as request/response dump, filtering
      and manipulation via DSL language, upstream HTTP/Socks5 proxy. Additionally a
      replay utility allows to import the dumped traffic (request/responses with correct
      domain name) into other tools by simply setting the upstream proxy to proxify.
