      '' GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
         them for transmission by electronic mail services.  A shell archive
         is a collection of files that can be unpacked by /bin/sh.  A wide
         range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing
         shars and in specifying shar smartness.  For example, shar may
         compress files, uuencode binary files, split long files and
         construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and
         provide simplistic checksums.

         GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of
         shell archives.  It will automatically strip off the mail headers
         and other introductory text.  The archive bodies are then unpacked
         by a copy of the shell. unshar may also process files containing
         concatenated shell archives.
