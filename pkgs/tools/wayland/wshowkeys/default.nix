      Displays keypresses on screen on supported Wayland compositors (requires
      wlr_layer_shell_v1 support).
      Note: This tool requires root permissions to read input events, but these
      permissions are dropped after startup. The NixOS module provides such a
      setuid binary (use "programs.wshowkeys.enable = true;").
