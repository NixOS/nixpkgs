Subject: grep -F: fix a heap buffer (read) overrun

grep's read buffer is often filled to its full size, except when
reading the final buffer of a file.  In that case, the number of
bytes read may be far less than the size of the buffer.  However, for
certain unusual pattern/text combinations, grep -F would mistakenly
examine bytes in that uninitialized region of memory when searching
for a match.  With carefully chosen inputs, one can cause grep -F to
read beyond the end of that buffer altogether.  This problem arose via
commit v2.18-90-g73893ff with the introduction of a more efficient
heuristic using what is now the memchr_kwset function. The use of
that function in bmexec_trans could leave TP much larger than EP,
and the subsequent call to bm_delta2_search would mistakenly access
beyond end of the main input read buffer.

* src/kwset.c (bmexec_trans): When TP reaches or exceeds EP,
do not call bm_delta2_search.
* tests/kwset-abuse: New file.
* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
* THANKS.in: Update.
* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

Prior to this patch, this command would trigger a UMR:

  printf %0360db 0 | valgrind src/grep -F $(printf %019dXb 0)

  Use of uninitialised value of size 8

See the accompanying test for how to trigger the heap buffer overrun.

Thanks to Nima Aghdaii for testing and finding numerous
ways to break early iterations of this patch.

Nix: @vcunat restricted this to the runtime code only to avoid needing autoreconfiguration.
