      dt is a utility and programming language. The utility is intended for
      ergonomic in-the-shell execution. The language is straightforward (in
      the most literal sense) with a minimal syntax that allows for
      high-level, higher-order programming.

      It's meant to supplement (not replace!) other tools like awk, sed,
      xargs, and shell built-ins. Something like the Perl one-liners popular
      yesteryear, but hopefully easier to read and reason through.

      In short, dt is intended to be generally useful, with zero pretense of
      elegance.
