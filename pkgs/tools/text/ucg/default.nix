      UniversalCodeGrep (ucg) is an extremely fast grep-like tool specialized
      for searching large bodies of source code. It is intended to be largely
      command-line compatible with Ack, to some extent with ag, and where
      appropriate with grep. Search patterns are specified as PCRE regexes.
