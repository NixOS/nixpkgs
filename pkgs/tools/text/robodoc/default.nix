    longDescription = ''
      ROBODoc is program documentation tool. The idea is to include for every
      function or procedure a standard header containing all sorts of
      information about the procedure or function. ROBODoc extracts these
      headers from the source file and puts them in a separate
      autodocs-file. ROBODoc thus allows you to include the program
      documentation in the source code and avoid having to maintain two separate
      documents. Or as Petteri puts it: "robodoc is very useful - especially for
      programmers who don't like writing documents with Word or some other
      strange tool."

      ROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats: HTML,
      RTF, LaTeX, or XML DocBook. In HTML mode it can generate cross links
      between headers. You can even include parts of your source code.

      ROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C, Pascal,
      Shell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript, Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++,
      Java -- basically any program in which you can use remarks/comments.
