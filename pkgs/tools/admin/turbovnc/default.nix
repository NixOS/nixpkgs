  # Notes:
  # * SSH support does not require `openssh` on PATH, because turbovnc
  #   uses a built-in SSH client ("JSch fork"), as commented on e.g.:
  #   https://github.com/TurboVNC/turbovnc/releases/tag/3.2beta1
  #
  # TODO:
  # * Build outputs that are unclear:
  #   * `-- FONT_ENCODINGS_DIRECTORY = /var/empty/share/X11/fonts/encodings`
  #     Maybe relevant what the tigervnc and tightvnc derivations
  #     do with their `fontDirectories`?
  #   * `XORG_REGISTRY_PATH = /var/empty/lib64/xorg`
  #   * The thing about xorg `protocol.txt`
  # * Add `enableClient ? true` flag that disables the client GUI
  #   so that the server can be built without openjdk dependency.
  # * Perhaps allow to build the client on non-Linux platforms.

    # We'd like to build against nixpkgs's `zlib-ng`, but if we pass
    # `-DTVNC_ZLIBNG=0`, the above logic seems to imply that it looks
