Subject: [PATCH] kubeconfig: don't store absolute path to gcloud binary
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The `gcloud beta container clusters get-credentials $cluster \
--region $region --project $project`
command can be used to write kubectl config files.

In that file, normally the absolute path to the `gcloud` binary is
stored.

This is a bad idea in NixOS. We might eventually garbage-collect that
specific gcloud binary - and in general, would expect a nix-shell
provided gcloud to be used.

In its current state, token renewal would just start to break with the
following error message:

Unable to connect to the server: error executing access token command "/nix/store/…/gcloud config config-helper --format=json": err=fork/exec /nix/store/…/gcloud: no such file or directory output= stderr=

Avoid this by storing just `gcloud` inside `cmd-path`, which causes
kubectl to lookup the gcloud command from $PATH, which is more likely to
keep working.
