    longDescription =
      ''gzip (GNU zip) is a popular data compression program written by
        Jean-loup Gailly for the GNU project.  Mark Adler wrote the
        decompression part.

        We developed this program as a replacement for compress because of
        the Unisys and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm used by
        compress.  These patents made it impossible for us to use compress,
        and we needed a replacement.  The superior compression ratio of gzip
        is just a bonus.
