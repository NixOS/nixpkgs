      '' XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with high
         compression ratio.  XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems,
         but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems.  XZ Utils are the
         successor to LZMA Utils.

         The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA SDK, but
         it has been modified quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils.  The
         primary compression algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used
         inside the .xz container format.  With typical files, XZ Utils
         create 30 % smaller output than gzip and 15 % smaller output than
         bzip2.
