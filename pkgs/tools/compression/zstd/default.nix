      Zstd, short for Zstandard, is a fast lossless compression algorithm,
      targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level compression
      ratio. Zstd can also offer stronger compression ratio at the cost of
      compression speed. Speed/ratio trade-off is configurable by small
      increment, to fit different situations. Note however that decompression
      speed is preserved and remain roughly the same at all settings, a
      property shared by most LZ compression algorithms, such as zlib.
