      Very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed
      at 400 MB/s per core, with near-linear scalability for multi-threaded
      applications. It also features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in
      multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on
      multi-core systems.
