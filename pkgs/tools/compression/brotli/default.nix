    longDescription =
      ''  Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that
          compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77
          algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a
          compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
          general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with
          deflate but offers more dense compression.

          The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined
          in the following internet draft:
          http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-alakuijala-brotli
