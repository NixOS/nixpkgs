      theHarvester is a very simple, yet effective tool designed to be used in the early
      stages of a penetration test. Use it for open source intelligence gathering and
      helping to determine an entity's external threat landscape on the internet. The tool
      gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using multiple public data sources.
