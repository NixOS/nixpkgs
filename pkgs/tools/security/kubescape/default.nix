      Kubescape is the first open-source tool for testing if Kubernetes is
      deployed securely according to multiple frameworks: regulatory, customized
      company policies and DevSecOps best practices, such as the NSA-CISA and
      the MITRE ATT&CKÂ®.
      Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, and detect
      misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities at early stages of the
      CI/CD pipeline and provides a risk score instantly and risk trends over
      time. Kubescape integrates natively with other DevOps tools, including
      Jenkins, CircleCI and Github workflows.
