# Expected result:
# An Eclipse instance should start, with the GhidraDev
# plugin attached as a debugger to a headless Ghidra
# that is built with an out-of-tree plugin. The debugger
# should stop in a breakpoint in the plugin source code
# and display the appropriate source location.

#TODO not yet implemented
