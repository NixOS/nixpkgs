        American fuzzy lop is a fuzzer that employs a novel type of
        compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to
        automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that
        trigger new internal states in the targeted binary. This
        substantially improves the functional coverage for the fuzzed
        code. The compact synthesized corpora produced by the tool are
        also useful for seeding other, more labor or resource-intensive
        testing regimes down the road.
