      gopass is a rewrite of the pass password manager in Go with the aim of
      making it cross-platform and adding additional features. Our target
      audience are professional developers and sysadmins (and especially teams
      of those) who are well versed with a command line interface. One explicit
      goal for this project is to make it more approachable to non-technical
      users. We go by the UNIX philosophy and try to do one thing and do it
      well, providing a stellar user experience and a sane, simple interface.
