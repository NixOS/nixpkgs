      Blahtex is a program written in C++, which converts an equation given in
      a syntax close to TeX into MathML. It is designed by David Harvey and is
      aimed at supporting equations in MediaWiki.

      Blahtexml is a simple extension of blahtex, written by Gilles Van Assche.
      In addition to the functionality of blahtex, blahtexml has XML processing
      in mind and is able to process a whole XML document into another XML
      document. Instead of converting only one formula at a time, blahtexml can
      convert all the formulas of the given XML file into MathML.
