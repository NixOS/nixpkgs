      sshlatex is a tool which uploads LaTeX source files to a remote, runs
      LaTeX there, and streams the resulting PDF file to the local host.
      Because sshlatex prestarts LaTeX with the previous run's preamble,
      thereby preloading the required LaTeX packages, it is also useful in a
      purely local setting.
