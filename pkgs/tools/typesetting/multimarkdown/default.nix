      MultiMarkdown is a lightweight markup language created by
      Fletcher T. Penney and based on Markdown, which supports
      more export-formats (html, latex, beamer, memoir, odf, opml,
      lyx, mmd) and implements some added features currently not
      available with plain Markdown syntax.

      It adds the following features to Markdown:

      - footnotes
      - tables
      - citations and bibliography (works best in LaTeX using BibTeX)
      - math support
      - automatic cross-referencing ability
      - smart typography, with support for multiple languages
      - image attributes
      - table and image captions
      - definition lists
      - glossary entries (LaTeX only)
      - document metadata (e.g. title, author, date, etc.)
