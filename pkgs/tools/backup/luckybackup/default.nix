      luckyBackup is an application for data back-up and synchronization 
      powered by the rsync tool.
      
      It is simple to use, fast (transfers over only changes made and not
      all data), safe (keeps your data safe by checking all declared directories
      before proceeding in any data manipulation), reliable and fully 
      customizable.
