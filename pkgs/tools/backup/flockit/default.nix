    longDescription = ''
      This library and tool exists solely because rsync doesn't have file locking.

      It's not used like a normal library; you don't link against it, and you
      don't have to patch your source code to use it. It's inserted between your
      program and its libraries by use of LD_PRELOAD.

      For example:

        $ env LD_PRELOAD=$(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/lib/libflockit.so FLOCKIT_FILE_PREFIX=test rsync SRC DEST

      Besides the library a handy executable is provided which can simplify the above to:

        $ $(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/bin/flockit test rsync SRC DEST
