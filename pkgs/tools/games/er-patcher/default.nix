      A tool aimed at enhancing the experience when playing the game on linux through proton or natively on windows.
      This tool is based on patching the game executable through hex-edits. However it is done in a safe and non-destructive way,
      that ensures the patched executable is never run with EAC enabled (unless explicity told to do so). Use at your own risk!
