      '' tmux is intended to be a modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen. Major features include:

          * A powerful, consistent, well-documented and easily scriptable command interface.
          * A window may be split horizontally and vertically into panes.
          * Panes can be freely moved and resized, or arranged into preset layouts.
          * Support for UTF-8 and 256-colour terminals.
          * Copy and paste with multiple buffers.
          * Interactive menus to select windows, sessions or clients.
          * Change the current window by searching for text in the target.
          * Terminal locking, manually or after a timeout.
          * A clean, easily extended, BSD-licensed codebase, under active development.
