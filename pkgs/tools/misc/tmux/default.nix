      tmux is intended to be a modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen. Major features include:
        * A powerful, consistent, well-documented and easily scriptable command interface.
        * A window may be split horizontally and vertically into panes.
        * Panes can be freely moved and resized, or arranged into preset layouts.
        * Support for UTF-8 and 256-colour terminals.
        * Copy and paste with multiple buffers.
        * Interactive menus to select windows, sessions or clients.
        * Change the current window by searching for text in the target.
        * Terminal locking, manually or after a timeout.
        * A clean, easily extended, BSD-licensed codebase, under active development.
