      The idevicerestore tool allows to restore firmware files to iOS devices.

      It is a full reimplementation of all granular steps which are performed during
      restore of a firmware to a device.

      In general, upgrades and downgrades are possible, however subject to
      availability of SHSH blobs from Apple for signing the firmare files.

      To restore a device to some firmware, simply run the following:
      $ sudo idevicerestore -l

      This will download and restore a device to the latest firmware available.
