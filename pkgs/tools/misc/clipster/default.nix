      Clipster was designed to try to add a good selection of useful features, while avoiding bad design decisions or becoming excessively large.
      Its feature list includes:
      - Event driven, rather than polling. More efficient, helps with power management.
      - Control over when it write to disk, for similar reasons.
      - Command-line options/config for everything.
      - No global keybindings - that's the job of a Window Manager
      - Sensible handling of unusual clipboard events. Some apps (Chrome, Emacs) trigger a clipboard 'update event' for every character you select, rather than just one event when you stop selecting.
      - Preserves the last item in clipboard after an application closes. (Many apps clear the clipboard on exit).
      - Minimal dependencies, no complicated build/install requirements.
      - utf-8 support
      - Proper handling of embedded newlines and control codes.
      - Smart matching of urls, emails, regexes. (extract_*)
      - Option to synchronise the SELECTION and CLIPBOARD clipboards. (sync_selections)
      - Option to track one or both clipboards. (active_selections)
      - Option to ignore clipboard updates form certain applications. (filter_classes)
      - Ability to delete items in clipboard history.
