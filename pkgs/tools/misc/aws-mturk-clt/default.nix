        The Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing marketplace that
        allows users (“requesters”) to submit tasks to be performed by
        other humans (“workers”) for a small fee.  This package
        contains command-line tools for submitting tasks, querying
        results, and so on.

        The command-line tools expect a file
        <filename>mturk.properties<filename> in the current directory,
        which should contain the following:

        <screen>
        access_key=[insert your access key here]
        secret_key=[insert your secret key here]
        service_url=http://mechanicalturk.amazonaws.com/?Service=AWSMechanicalTurkRequester
        </screen>
      '';
  };
}
