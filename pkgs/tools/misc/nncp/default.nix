      This utilities are intended to help build up small size (dozens of
      nodes) ad-hoc friend-to-friend (F2F) statically routed darknet
      delay-tolerant networks for fire-and-forget secure reliable files,
      file requests, Internet mail and commands transmission. All
      packets are integrity checked, end-to-end encrypted, explicitly
      authenticated by known participants public keys. Onion encryption
      is applied to relayed packets. Each node acts both as a client and
      server, can use push and poll behaviour model.

      Out-of-box offline sneakernet/floppynet, dead drops, sequential
      and append-only CD-ROM/tape storages, air-gapped computers
      support. But online TCP daemon with full-duplex resumable data
      transmission exists.
