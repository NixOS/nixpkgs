      GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages
      of software and/or data located in separate directories on the
      filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same
      place. For example, /usr/local/bin could contain symlinks to
      files within /usr/local/stow/emacs/bin, /usr/local/stow/perl/bin
      etc., and likewise recursively for any other subdirectories such
      as .../share, .../man, and so on.
