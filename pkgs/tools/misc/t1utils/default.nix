      t1utils is a collection of simple type-1 font manipulation programs.
      Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB (binary)
      formats, disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable form,
      reassemble them into PFA or PFB format. Additionally you can extract font
      resources from a Macintosh font file or create a Macintosh Type 1 font
      file from a PFA or PFB font.
