    longDescription = ''
      Unix's `time` utility is a simple and often effective way of measuring
      how long a command takes to run. Unfortunately, running a command once
      can give misleading timings: the process may create a cache on its first
      execution, running faster subsequently; other processes may cause the
      command to be starved of CPU or IO time; etc. It is common to see people
      run `time` several times and take whichever values they feel most
      comfortable with. Inevitably, this causes problems.

      `multitime` is, in essence, a simple extension to time which runs a
      command multiple times and prints the timing means (with confidence
      intervals), standard deviations, minimums, medians, and maximums having
      done so. This can give a much better understanding of the command's
      performance.
