      The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how
      to receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the
      need to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to
      support open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.)
      sending to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends. The Contrib
      edition provides aditional vendor specific receivers/exporters and/or
      components that are only useful to a relatively small number of users and
      is multiple times larger as a result.
