      `nb` creates notes in text-based formats like Markdown, Emacs Org mode,
      and LaTeX, can work with files in any format, can import and export notes
      to many document formats, and can create private, password-protected
      encrypted notes and bookmarks. With `nb`, you can write notes using Vim,
      Emacs, VS Code, Sublime Text, and any other text editor you like. `nb`
      works in any standard Linux / Unix environment, including macOS and
      Windows via WSL. Optional dependencies can be installed to enhance
      functionality, but `nb` works great without them.

      `nb` is also a powerful text-based CLI bookmarking system. Page
      information is automatically downloaded, compiled, and saved into normal
      Markdown documents made for humans, so bookmarks are easy to edit just
      like any other note.

      `nb` uses Git in the background to automatically record changes and sync
      notebooks with remote repositories. `nb` can also be configured to sync
      notebooks using a general purpose syncing utility like Dropbox so notes
      can be edited in other apps on any device.

      `nb` is designed to be portable, future-focused, and vendor independent,
      providing a full-featured and intuitive experience within a highly
      composable user-centric text interface. The entire program is a single
      well-tested shell script that can be installed, copied, or curled almost
      anywhere and just work, using progressive enhancement for various
      experience improvements in more capable environments. `nb` works great
      whether you have one notebook with just a few notes or dozens of
      notebooks containing thousands of notes, bookmarks, and other items. `nb`
      makes it easy to incorporate other tools, writing apps, and workflows.
      `nb` can be used a little, a lot, once in a while, or for just a subset
      of features. `nb` is flexible.
