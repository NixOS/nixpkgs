      Fpart is a tool that helps you sort file trees and pack them into bags
      (called "partitions").

      It splits a list of directories and file trees into a certain number of
      partitions, trying to produce partitions with the same size and number of
      files. It can also produce partitions with a given number of files or a
      limited size.

      Once generated, partitions are either printed as file lists to stdout
      (default) or to files. Those lists can then be used by third party programs.

      Fpart also includes a live mode, which allows it to crawl very large
      filesystems and produce partitions in live. Hooks are available to act on
      those partitions (e.g. immediatly start a transfer using rsync(1))
      without having to wait for the filesystem traversal job to be finished.
      Used this way, fpart can be seen as a powerful data migration tool.
