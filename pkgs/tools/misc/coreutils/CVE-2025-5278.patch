Subject: sort: fix buffer under-read (CWE-127)

* src/sort.c (begfield): Check pointer adjustment
to avoid Out-of-range pointer offset (CWE-823).
(limfield): Likewise.
* tests/sort/sort-field-limit.sh: Add a new test,
which triggers with ASAN or Valgrind.
* tests/local.mk: Reference the new test.
* NEWS: Mention bug fix introduced in v7.2 (2009).

   [bug introduced in coreutils-9.6]
 
+  sort with key character offsets of SIZE_MAX, could induce
+  a read of 1 byte before an allocated heap buffer. For example:
+  'sort +0.18446744073709551615R input' on 64 bit systems.
