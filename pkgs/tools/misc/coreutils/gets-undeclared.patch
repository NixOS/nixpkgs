This patch is needed to allow builds with newer versions of
the GNU libc (2.16+).

    stdio: don't assume gets any more
    
    Gnulib intentionally does not have a gets module, and now that C11
    and glibc have dropped it, we should be more proactive about warning
    any user on a platform that still has a declaration of this dangerous
    interface.
    
    * m4/stdio_h.m4 (gl_STDIO_H, gl_STDIO_H_DEFAULTS): Drop gets
    support.
    * modules/stdio (Makefile.am): Likewise.
    * lib/stdio-read.c (gets): Likewise.
    * tests/test-stdio-c++.cc: Likewise.
    * m4/warn-on-use.m4 (gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE): Fix comment.
    * lib/stdio.in.h (gets): Make warning occur in more places.
    * doc/posix-functions/gets.texi (gets): Update documentation.

    efficient than snprintf in those safe cases; and as proof of our
    belief, we use sprintf in several gnulib modules.  So this header
