    It works by executing scripts in directories when you enter and leave them.
    This is done by overriding the shell builtins cd, pushd, and popd,
     which is a manual action.
    The user is required to add a snippet to their shell initialisation file like .bashrc or .profile.

    Which commands are executed on directory entry and leave is done
     in predefined locations with a .ondirrc file.

    See man ondir for more information
