      RIG (Random Identity Generator) is a free replacement for a shareware
      program out there called 'fake'. It generates random, yet real-looking,
      personal data. It is useful if you need to feed a name to a Web site,
      BBS, or real person, and are too lazy to think of one yourself. Also,
      if the Web site/BBS/person you are giving the information to tries to
      cross-check the city, state, zip, or area code, it will check out.
