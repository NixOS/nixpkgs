      Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage your
      browser's profile in tmpfs and to periodically sync it back to your
      physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step and
      an innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization
      between the two. One of the major design goals of psd is a completely
      transparent user experience.
