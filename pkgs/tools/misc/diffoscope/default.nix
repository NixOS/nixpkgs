      diffoscope will try to get to the bottom of what makes files or directories
      different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds and transform
      various binary formats into more human readable form to compare them. It can
      compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just as easily. The differences can
      be shown in a text or HTML report.

      diffoscope is developed as part of the "reproducible builds" Debian
      project and was formerly known as "debbindiff".
