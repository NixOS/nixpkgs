    longDescription = ''
      A set of fast command-line tools for extracting information from
      the Gimp's native file format XCF.

      The tools are designed to allow efficient use of layered XCF
      files as sources in a build system that use 'make' and similar
      tools to manage automatic processing of the graphics.

      These tools work independently of the Gimp engine and do not
      require the Gimp to even be installed.
