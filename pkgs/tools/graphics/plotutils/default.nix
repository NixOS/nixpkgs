    longDescription =
      '' The GNU plotutils package contains software for both programmers and
         technical users.  Its centerpiece is libplot, a powerful C/C++
         function library for exporting 2-D vector graphics in many file
         formats, both vector and raster.  It can also do vector graphics
         animations.

         libplot is device-independent in the sense that its API (application
         programming interface) does not depend on the type of graphics file
         to be exported.

         Besides libplot, the package contains command-line programs for
         plotting scientific data.  Many of them use libplot to export
         graphics.
