      The Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) format is
      widely supported by mobile and desktop graphics hardware and
      provides better quality at a given bitrate compared to ETC2.

      This program supports both compression and decompression in LDR
      and HDR mode and can read various image formats. Run `astcenc
      -help` to see all the options.
