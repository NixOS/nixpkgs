      Auto Adjust Photo tries to give a solution for the automatic color
      correction of photos. This means setting the contrast, color balance,
      saturation and gamma levels of the image by analization.

      This can be a solution for those kind of users who are not able to manage
      and correct images with complicated graphical softwares, or just simply
      don't intend to spend a lot of time with manually correcting the images
      one-by-one.
