	PDF Redact Tools helps with securely redacting and stripping metadata
	from documents before publishing. Note that this is not a security tool.
        It uses ImageMagick to parse PDFs.  While ImageMagick is a versatile tool, it has
        a history of several security bugs. A malicious PDF could exploit a bug in
        ImageMagick to take over your computer. If you're working with potentially
        malicious PDFs, it's safest to run them through PDF Redact Tools in an isolated
        environment, such as a virtual machine, or by using a tool such as the Qubes
        PDF Converter instead.
