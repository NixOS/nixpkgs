      Daemon turns other process into daemons. There are many tasks that need
      to be performed to correctly set up a daemon process. This can be tedious.
      Daemon performs these tasks for other processes. This is useful for
      writing daemons in languages other than C, C++ or Perl (e.g. /bin/sh,
      Java).
