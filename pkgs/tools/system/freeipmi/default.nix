    longDescription =
      '' GNU FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on
         the IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.  The IPMI specification defines a
         set of interfaces for platform management and is implemented by a
         number vendors for system management.  The features of IPMI that
         most users will be interested in are sensor monitoring, system event
         monitoring, power control, and serial-over-LAN (SOL).  The FreeIPMI
         tools and libraries listed below should provide users with the
         ability to access and utilize these and many other features.  A
         number of useful features for large HPC or cluster environments have
         also been implemented into FreeIPMI. See the README or FAQ for more
         info.
