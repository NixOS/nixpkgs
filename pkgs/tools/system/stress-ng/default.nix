      Stress test a system in various selectable ways, exercising both various
      physical subsystems and various operating system kernel interfaces:
      - over 130 different stress tests
      - over 70 CPU specific stress tests that exercise floating point,
        integer, bit manipulation and control flow
      - over 20 virtual memory stress tests
      stress-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip
      hardware issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating system
      bugs that only occur when a system is being thrashed hard.
