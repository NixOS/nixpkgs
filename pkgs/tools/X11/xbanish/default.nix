      xbanish hides the mouse cursor when you start typing, and shows it again when
      the mouse cursor moves or a mouse button is pressed.  This is similar to
      xterm's pointerMode setting, but xbanish works globally in the X11 session.

      unclutter's -keystroke mode is supposed to do this, but it's broken[0].  I
      looked into fixing it, but the unclutter source code is terrible, so I wrote
      xbanish.

      The name comes from ratpoison's "banish" command that sends the cursor to the
      corner of the screen.
