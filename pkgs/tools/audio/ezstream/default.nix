      Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media
      streaming servers. It began as the successor of the old "shout"
      utility, and has since gained a lot of useful features.

      In its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data
      from standard input without reencoding and thus requires only
      very little CPU resources.
