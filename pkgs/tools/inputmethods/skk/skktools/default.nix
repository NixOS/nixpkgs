# - Version 1.3.3 dates from Jul. 19, 2013.
# - The latest commit to the github repo dates from Mar. 05, 2017
# - The repo since appears to have become a kitchen sink place to keep
#   misc tools to handle SKK dictionaries, and these tools have runtime
#   dependencies on a Ruby interpreter etc.
# - We for the moment do not package them to keep the dependencies slim.
#   Probably, shall package the newer tools as skktools-extra in the future.
