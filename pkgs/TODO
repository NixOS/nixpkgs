* Bump freetype to 2.1.7 (but it breaks Pango 1.2.5).

* Patch development/tools/misc/libtool not to search standard
  directories for libraries (like setup.sh does now). [do we want
  this?]

* In setup.sh: add configureFlagsArray or something

* Inform freedesktop people that Xaw requires Xpm.

* After building gcc, filter out references to /tmp/nix... in
  .../lib/libsupc++.la and .../lib/libstdc++.la

* diffutils retains a dependency on coreutils/bin/pr; causes stdenv to
  depend on 2 copies of coreutils (the first one impure in
  stdenv-nix-linux!)



* change dontMake & dontMakeInstall into dontBuild and dontInstall in
  ./development/libraries/xlibs/xlibs/builder.sh (or put it in its
  default.nix)
