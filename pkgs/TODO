* Bump freetype to 2.1.7 (but it breaks Pango 1.2.5).

* In setup.sh, remove " -a -f ./ltmain.sh" (and then remove ltmain stuff from Subversion)

* Patch development/tools/misc/libtool not to search standard
  directories for libraries (like setup.sh does now). [do we want
  this?]

* Bug in ld-wrapper: should source in add-flags (like gcc-wrapper) - then fix uml builder

* In setup.sh: move "test -x $configureScript" into "if test -z $configureScript..."

* In setup.sh: remove bogus stopNest in configureW

* In setup.sh: add configureFlagsArray or something


* Inform freedesktop people that Xaw requires Xpm.
