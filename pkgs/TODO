* Bump freetype to 2.1.7 (but it breaks Pango 1.2.5).

* In setup.sh, remove " -a -f ./ltmain.sh" (and then remove ltmain stuff from Subversion)

* Patch development/tools/misc/libtool not to search standard
  directories for libraries (like setup.sh does now). [do we want
  this?]


* Inform freedesktop people that Xaw requires Xpm.
