### Deprecated aliases - for backward compatibility
### Please maintain this list in ASCIIbetical ordering.
### Hint: the "sections" are delimited by ### <letter> ###

# backward compatibility in projects outside of nixpkgs. See the
# documentation for the `allowAliases` option for more background.

# A script to convert old aliases to throws and remove old
# throws can be found in './maintainers/scripts/remove-old-aliases.py'.

# Add 'preserve, reason: reason why' after the date if the alias should not be removed.
# Try to keep them to a minimum.
# valid examples of what to preserve:
#   distro aliases such as:
#     debian-package-name -> nixos-package-name
