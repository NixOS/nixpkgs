    The attribute `linuxPackages_hardened_latest' was dropped because the hardened patches
    frequently lag behind the upstream kernel. In some cases this meant that this attribute
    had to refer to an older kernel[1] because the latest hardened kernel was EOL and
    the latest supported kernel didn't have patches.

    If you want to use a hardened kernel, please check which kernel minors are supported
    and use a versioned attribute, e.g. `linuxPackages_5_10_hardened'.
