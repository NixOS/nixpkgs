/* This function composes the Nix Packages collection. It:

     1. Applies the final stage to the given `config` if it is a function

     2. Infers an appropriate `platform` based on the `system` if none is
        provided

     3. Defaults to no non-standard config and no cross-compilation target

     4. Uses the above to infer the default standard environment's (stdenv's)
        stages if no stdenv's are provided

     5. Folds the stages to yield the final fully booted package set for the
        chosen stdenv

   Use `impure.nix` to also infer the `system` based on the one on which
   evaluation is taking place, and the configuration from environment variables
   or dot-files. */
