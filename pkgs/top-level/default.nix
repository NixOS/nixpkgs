/* This function composes the Nix Packages collection. It:

     1. Applies the final stage to the given `config` if it is a function

     2. Infers an appropriate `platform` based on the `system` if none is
        provided

     3. Defaults to no non-standard config and no cross-compilation target

     4. Uses the above to infer the default standard environment's (stdenv's)
        stages if no stdenv's are provided

     5. Folds the stages to yield the final fully booted package set for the
        chosen stdenv

   Use `impure.nix` to also infer the `system` based on the one on which
   evaluation is taking place, and the configuration from environment variables
   or dot-files. */

  # A few packages make a new package set to draw their dependencies from.
  # (Currently to get a cross tool chain, or forced-i686 package.) Rather than
  # give `all-packages.nix` all the arguments to this function, even ones that
  # don't concern it, we give it this function to "re-call" nixpkgs, inheriting
  # whatever arguments it doesn't explicitly provide. This way,
  # `all-packages.nix` doesn't know more than it needs too.
  #
  # It's OK that `args` doesn't include default arguments from this file:
  # they'll be deterministically inferred. In fact we must *not* include them,
  # because it's important that if some parameter which affects the default is
  # substituted with a different argument, the default is re-inferred.
  #
  # To put this in concrete terms, this function is basically just used today to
  # use package for a different platform for the current platform (namely cross
  # compiling toolchains and 32-bit packages on x86_64). In both those cases we
  # want the provided non-native `localSystem` argument to affect the stdenv
  # chosen.
  #
  # NB!!! This thing gets its `config` argument from `args`, i.e. it's actually
  # `config0`. It is important to keep it to `config0` format (as opposed to the
  # result of `evalModules`, i.e. the `config` variable above) throughout all
  # nixpkgs evaluations since the above function `config0 -> config` implemented
  # via `evalModules` is not idempotent. In other words, if you add `config` to
  # `newArgs`, expect strange very hard to debug errors! (Yes, I'm speaking from
  # experience here.)
