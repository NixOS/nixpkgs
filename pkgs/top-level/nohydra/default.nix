#
# Usage:
#
#   nix-build pkgs/top-level/nohydra -A release-drvpaths
#   pkgs/top-level/nohydra/instantiate.sh
#   nix-build pkgs/top-level/nohydra -A release --keep-going
#
# Technically you can omit the first command and it will get
# re-executed as part of instantiate.sh, but I prefer to run it
# separately so that the second step (which is the only non
# nix-build step) always runs very quickly.  nix-build gives good
# feedback on its progress.
#
# Why are there three steps?
#
# Short answer: in order to exploit `nix-instantiate` / `nix-build`
# separation, which is the trick to being able to do release builds
# without the Hydra software.
#
# Long answer:
#
# 1. Generating the list of release attrpaths requires a lot of
#    memory; generating the list of release drvpaths requires an
#    even larger amount of memory, and a *huge* amount of
#    processing.  The first command generates both of these
#    (attrpaths and drvpaths).  This is all done inside of a Nix
#    derivation, which ensures that the list depends only on the git
#    HEAD commit-hash, and also that this expensive work isn't done
#    over again unless that commit has changed.
#
# 2. The second command iterates over the list of attrpaths/drvpaths
#    and runs `nix-instantiate` on each attrpath whose drvpath
#    doesn't exist in the local store.  This cannot be done from
#    inside a derivation (at least not without recursive-nix).
#
# 3. The third command builds all the derivations in one massive
#    build.  This is possible because it starts from a list of
#    derivations -- the Nix evaluator (libexpr) does almost no work
#    in the third command.
