/* This file defines the composition for Lua packages.  It has
   been factored out of all-packages.nix because there are many of
   them.  Also, because most Nix expressions for Lua packages are
   trivial, most are actually defined here.  I.e. there's no function
   for each package in a separate file: the call to the function would
   be almost as must code as the function itself. */
