# Haskell packages in Nixpkgs
#
# This file defines a function parameterized by the following:
#
#    pkgs:
#       the whole Nixpkgs (so that we can depend on non-Haskell packages)
#
#    newScope:
#       for redefining callPackage locally to resolve dependencies of
#       Haskell packages automatically
#
#    ghc:
#       the GHC version to be used for building the Haskell packages
#
#    prefFun:
#       version preferences for Haskell packages (see below)
#
#    enableLibraryProfiling:
#       Boolean flag indicating whether profiling libraries for all Haskell
#       packages should be built. If a library is to be built with profiling
#       enabled, its dependencies should have profiling enabled as well.
#       Therefore, this is implemented as a global flag.
#
#    modifyPrio:
#       Either the identity function or lowPrio is intended to be passed
#       here. The idea is that we can make a complete set of Haskell packages
#       have low priority from the outside.
#
#
# Policy for keeping multiple versions:
#
# We keep multiple versions for
#
#    * packages that are part of the Haskell Platform
#    * packages that are known to have severe interface changes
#
# For the packages where we keep multiple versions, version x.y.z is mapped
# to an attribute of name package_x_y_z and stored in a Nix expression called
# x.y.z.nix. There is no default.nix for such packages. There also is an
# attribute package that is defined to be self.package_x_y_z where x.y.z is
# the default version of the package. The global default can be overridden by
# passing a preferences function.
#
# For most packages, however, we keep only one version, and use default.nix.
