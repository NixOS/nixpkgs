# This expression will, as efficiently as possible, dump a
# *superset* of all attrpaths of derivations which might be
# part of a release on *any* platform.
#
# Both this expression and what ofborg uses (release-outpaths.nix)
# are essentially single-threaded (under the current cppnix
# implementation).
#
# This expression runs much, much, much faster and uses much, much
# less memory than the ofborg script by skipping the
# platform-relevance checks.  The ofborg outpaths.nix script takes
# half an hour on a 3ghz core and peaks at 60gbytes of memory; this
# expression runs on the same machine in 44 seconds with peak memory
# usage of 5gbytes.
#
# Once you have the list of attrnames you can split it up into
# $NUM_CORES batches and run the platform checks separately for each
# batch, in parallel.
#
# To dump the attrnames:
#
#   nix-instantiate --eval --strict --json pkgs/top-level/release-attrpaths-superset.nix -A names
#
{ lib ? import (path + "/lib")
