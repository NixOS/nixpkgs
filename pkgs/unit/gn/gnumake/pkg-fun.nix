      Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and
      other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

      Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file
      called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and
      how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you
      should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make
      to build and install the program.
