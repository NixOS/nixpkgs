      This package provides a replacement for `uname` whose output depends only
      on `stdenv.buildPlatform`.  It is meant to be used from within derivations.
      Many packages' build processes run `uname` at compile time and embed its
      output into the result of the build.  Since `uname` calls into the kernel,
      and the Nix sandbox currently does not intercept these calls, builds made
      on different kernels will produce different results.
