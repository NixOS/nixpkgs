      DigiTemp is a command line application used for reading 1-wire sensors like
      the DS18S20 temperature sensor, or DS2438 battery monitor. DigiTemp supports
      the following devices:

        DS18S20 (and older DS1820) Temperature Sensor
        DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
        DS1822 Temperature Sensor
        DS2438 Battery monitor
        DS2409 1-wire coupler (used in 1-wire hubs)
        DS2422 Counter
        DS2423 Counter

      The output format can be customized and all settings are stored in a
      configuration file (.digitemprc) in the current directory. DigiTemp can
      repeatedly read the sensors and output to stdout and/or to a logfile.
