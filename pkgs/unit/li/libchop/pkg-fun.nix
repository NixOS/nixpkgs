      '' Libchop is a set of utilities and library for data backup and
         distributed storage.  Its main application is chop-backup, an
         encrypted backup program that supports data integrity checks,
         versioning at little cost, distribution among several sites,
         selective sharing of stored data, adaptive compression, and more.
         The library itself, which chop-backup builds upon, implements
         storage techniques such as content-based addressing, content hash
         keys, Merkle trees, similarity detection, and lossless compression.
         It makes it easy to combine them in different ways.  The
         ‘chop-archiver’ and ‘chop-block-server’ tools, illustrated in the
         manual, provide direct access to these facilities from the command
         line.  It is written in C and has Guile (Scheme) bindings.
