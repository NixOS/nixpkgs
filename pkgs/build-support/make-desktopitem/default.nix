  => «derivation /nix/store/sh017x5n50i2qwns2na1sxdp7zb2zgcw-Eclipse.desktop.drv»
  ```

  # Type

  ```
  makeDesktopItem :: AttrSet -> Derivation

    - `path` (string): The `Path` of the desktop entry
    - `terminal` (bool): The `Terminal` of the desktop entry
    - `actions` (AttrSet): An attrset of [internal name] -> { name, exec?, icon? } representing the `Actions` of the desktop entry
    - `mimeTypes` (string[]): The `MimeType` of the desktop entry

    - `extraConfig` (AttrSet): Additional values to be added literally to the final item, e.g. vendor extensions

  # Output

  A derivation that contains the output desktop entry file.

  # Developer Note

  All possible values are as defined by the spec, version 1.4.
