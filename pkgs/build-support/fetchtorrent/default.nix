  # For a while, the transmission backend would put the downloaded torrent in
  # the output directory, but whether the rqbit backend would put the output in
  # the output directory or a subdirectory depended on the version of rqbit.
  # We want to standardise on a single behaviour, but give users of
  # fetchtorrent with the rqbit backend some warning that the behaviour might
  # be unexpected, particularly since we can't know what behaviour users might
  # be expecting at this point, and they probably wouldn't notice a change
  # straight away because the results are fixed-output derivations.
  #
  # This warning was introduced for 25.11, so we can remove handling of the
  # `flatten` argument once that release is no longer supported.

          `fetchtorrent` with the rqbit backend may or may not have the
          downloaded files stored in a subdirectory of the output directory.
          Verify which behaviour you need, and set the `flatten` argument to
          `fetchtorrent` accordingly.

          The `flatten = false` behaviour will still produce a warning, as this
          behaviour is deprecated.  It is only available with the "rqbit" backend
          to provide temporary support for users who are relying on the
          previous incorrect behaviour.  For a warning-free evaluation, use
          `flatten = true`.
