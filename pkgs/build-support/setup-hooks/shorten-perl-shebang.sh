# This setup hook modifies a Perl script so that any "-I" flags in its shebang
# line are rewritten into a "use lib ..." statement on the next line. This gets
# around a limitation in Darwin, which will not properly handle a script whose
# shebang line exceeds 511 characters.
#
# Each occurrence of "-I /path/to/lib1" or "-I/path/to/lib2" is removed from
# the shebang line, along with the single space that preceded it. These library
# paths are placed into a new line of the form
#
#     use lib "/path/to/lib1", "/path/to/lib2";
#
# immediately following the shebang line. If a library appeared in the original
# list more than once, only its first occurrence will appear in the output
# list. In other words, the libraries are deduplicated, but the ordering of the
# first appearance of each one is preserved.
#
# Any flags other than "-I" in the shebang line are left as-is, and the
# interpreter is also left alone (although the script will abort if the
# interpreter does not seem to be either "perl" or else "env" with "perl" as
# its argument). Each line after the shebang line is left unchanged. Each file
# is modified in place.
#
# Usage:
#     shortenPerlShebang SCRIPT...
