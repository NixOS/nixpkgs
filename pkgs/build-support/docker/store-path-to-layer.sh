# store while tar is running, it will detect a change to
# /nix/store and fail. Instead, if we cd into the nix store
# and copy the relative nix store path, tar will ignore
# changes to /nix/store. In order to create the correct
# structure in the tar file, we transform the relative nix
# store path to the absolute store path.
