    Override arguments to mkCoqDerivation for a Coq library.

    This function allows you to easily override arguments to mkCoqDerivation,
    even when they are not exposed by the Coq library directly.

    Type: overrideCoqDerivation :: AttrSet -> CoqLibraryDerivation -> CoqLibraryDerivation

    Example:

    ```nix
    coqPackages.lib.overrideCoqDerivation
      {
        defaultVersion = "9999";
        release."9999".hash = "sha256-fDoP11rtrIM7+OLdMisv2EF7n/IbGuwFxHiPtg3qCNM=";
      }
      coqPackages.QuickChick;
    ```

    This example overrides the `defaultVersion` and `release` arguments that
    are passed to `mkCoqDerivation` in the QuickChick derivation.

    Note that there is a difference between using `.override` on a Coq
    library vs this `overrideCoqDerivation` function. `.override` allows you
    to modify arguments to the derivation itself, for instance by passing
    different versions of dependencies:

    ```nix
    coqPackages.QuickChick.override { ssreflect = my-cool-ssreflect; }
    ```

    whereas `overrideCoqDerivation` allows you to override arguments to the
    call to `mkCoqDerivation` in the Coq library.

    Note that all Coq libraries in Nixpkgs have a `version` argument for
    easily using a different version.  So if all you want to do is use a
    different version, and the derivation for the Coq library already has
    support for the version you want, you likely only need to update the
    `version` argument on the library derivation.  This is done with
    `.override`:

    ```nix
    coqPackages.QuickChick.override { version = "1.4.0"; }
    ```
  */
  overrideCoqDerivation =
    f: drv:
    (drv.override (args: {
      mkCoqDerivation = drv_: (args.mkCoqDerivation drv_).override f;
    }));
})
