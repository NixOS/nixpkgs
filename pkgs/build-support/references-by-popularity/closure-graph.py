# IMPORTANT: Making changes?

# Using a simple algorithm, convert the references to a path in to a
# sorted list of dependent paths based on how often they're referenced
# and how deep in the tree they live. Equally-"popular" paths are then
# sorted by name.
#
# The existing writeReferencesToFile prints the paths in a simple
# ascii-based sorting of the paths.
#
# Sorting the paths by graph improves the chances that the difference
# between two builds appear near the end of the list, instead of near
# the beginning. This makes a difference for Nix builds which export a
# closure for another program to consume, if that program implements its
# own level of binary diffing.
#
# For an example, Docker Images. If each store path is a separate layer
# then Docker Images can be very efficiently transfered between systems,
# and we get very good cache reuse between images built with the same
# version of Nixpkgs. However, since Docker only reliably supports a
# small number of layers (42) it is important to pick the individual
# layers carefully. By storing very popular store paths in the first 40
# layers, we improve the chances that the next Docker image will share
# many of those layers.*
#
# Given the dependency tree:
#
#     A - B - C - D -\
#      \   \   \      \
#       \   \   \      \
#        \   \ - E ---- F
#         \- G
#
# Nodes which have multiple references are duplicated:
#
#     A - B - C - D - F
#      \   \   \
#       \   \   \- E - F
#        \   \
#         \   \- E - F
#          \
#           \- G
#
# Each leaf node is now replaced by a counter defaulted to 1:
#
#     A - B - C - D - (F:1)
#      \   \   \
#       \   \   \- E - (F:1)
#        \   \
#         \   \- E - (F:1)
#          \
#           \- (G:1)
#
# Then each leaf counter is merged with its parent node, replacing the
# parent node with a counter of 1, and each existing counter being
# incremented by 1. That is to say `- D - (F:1)` becomes `- (D:1, F:2)`:
#
#     A - B - C - (D:1, F:2)
#      \   \   \
#       \   \   \- (E:1, F:2)
#        \   \
#         \   \- (E:1, F:2)
#          \
#           \- (G:1)
#
# Then each leaf counter is merged with its parent node again, merging
# any counters, then incrementing each:
#
#     A - B - (C:1, D:2, E:2, F:5)
#      \   \
#       \   \- (E:1, F:2)
#        \
#         \- (G:1)
#
# And again:
#
#     A - (B:1, C:2, D:3, E:4, F:8)
#      \
#       \- (G:1)
#
# And again:
#
#     (A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4, E:5, F:9, G:2)
#
# and then paths have the following "popularity":
#
#     A     1
#     B     2
#     C     3
#     D     4
#     E     5
#     F     9
#     G     2
#
# and the popularity contest would result in the paths being printed as:
#
#     F
#     E
#     D
#     C
#     B
#     G
#     A
#
# * Note: People who have used a Dockerfile before assume Docker's
# Layers are inherently ordered. However, this is not true -- Docker
# layers are content-addressable and are not explicitly layered until
# they are composed in to an Image.
