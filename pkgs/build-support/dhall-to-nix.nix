/* `dhallToNix` is a utility function to convert expressions in the Dhall
    configuration language to their corresponding Nix expressions.

    Example:
      dhallToNix "{ foo = 1, bar = True }"
      => { foo = 1; bar = true; }
      dhallToNix "λ(x : Bool) → x == False"
      => x : x == false
      dhallToNix "λ(x : Bool) → x == False" false
      => true

    See https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall-nix/docs/Dhall-Nix.html for
    a longer tutorial

    Note that this uses "import from derivation", meaning that Nix will perform
    a build during the evaluation phase if you use this `dhallToNix` utility
