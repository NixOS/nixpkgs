   #
   # Default: no renames.
   #
   # Example:
   #
   # `crateRenames` supports two formats.
   #
   # The simple version is an attrset that maps the
   # `crateName`s of the dependencies to their alternative
   # names.
   #
   # ```nix
   # {
   #   my_crate_name = "my_alternative_name";
   #   # ...
   # }
   # ```
   #
   # The extended version is also keyed by the `crateName`s but allows
   # different names for different crate versions:
   #
   # ```nix
   # {
   #   my_crate_name = [
   #       { version = "1.2.3"; rename = "my_alternative_name01"; }
   #       { version = "3.2.3"; rename = "my_alternative_name03"; }
   #   ]
   #   # ...
   # }
   # ```
   #
   # This roughly corresponds to the following snippet in Cargo.toml:
   #
   # ```toml
   # [dependencies]
   # my_alternative_name01 = { package = "my_crate_name", version = "0.1" }
   # my_alternative_name03 = { package = "my_crate_name", version = "0.3" }
   # ```
   #
   # Dependencies which use the lib target name as extern name, do not need
   # to be specified in the crateRenames, even if their crate name differs.
   #
   # Including multiple versions of a crate is very popular during
   # ecosystem transitions, e.g. from futures 0.1 to futures 0.3.
