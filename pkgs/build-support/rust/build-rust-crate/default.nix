      # The simple version is an attrset that maps the
      # `crateName`s of the dependencies to their alternative
      # names.

      # {

      # ```

      # The extended version is also keyed by the `crateName`s but allows
      # different names for different crate versions:
      #
      # ```nix
      # {
      #   my_crate_name = [
      #       { version = "1.2.3"; rename = "my_alternative_name01"; }
      #       { version = "3.2.3"; rename = "my_alternative_name03"; }
      #   ]
      #   # ...
      # }
      # ```
      #
      # This roughly corresponds to the following snippet in Cargo.toml:
      #
      # ```toml
      # [dependencies]
      # my_alternative_name01 = { package = "my_crate_name", version = "0.1" }
      # my_alternative_name03 = { package = "my_crate_name", version = "0.3" }
      # ```

      # to be specified in the crateRenames, even if their crate name differs.
