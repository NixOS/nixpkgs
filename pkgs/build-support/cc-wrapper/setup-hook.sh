# CC Wrapper hygiene
#
# For at least cross compilation, we need to depend on multiple cc-wrappers at
# once---specifically up to one per sort of dependency. This follows from having
# different tools targeting different platforms, and different flags for those
# tools. For example:
#
#   # Flags for compiling (whether or not linking) C code for the...
#   NIX_BUILD_CFLAGS_COMPILE  # ...build platform
#   NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE        # ...host platform
#   NIX_TARGET_CFLAGS_COMPILE # ...target platform
#
# Notice that these platforms are the 3 *relative* to the package using
# cc-wrapper, not absolute like `x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`.
#
# The simplest solution would be to have separate cc-wrappers per (3 intended
# use-cases * n absolute concrete platforms). For the use-case axis, we would
# @-splice in 'BUILD_' '' 'TARGET_' to use the write environment variables when
# building the cc-wrapper, and likewise prefix the binaries' names so they didn't
# clobber each other on the PATH. But the need for 3x cc-wrappers, along with
# non-standard name prefixes, is annoying and liable to break packages' build
# systems.
#
# Instead, we opt to have just one cc-wrapper per absolute platform. Matching
# convention, the binaries' names can just be prefixed with their target
# platform. On the other hand, that means packages will depend on not just
# multiple cc-wrappers, but the exact same cc-wrapper derivation multiple ways.
# That means the exact same cc-wrapper derivation must be able to avoid
# conflicting with itself, despite the fact that `setup-hook.sh`, the `addCvars`
# function, and `add-flags.sh` are all communicating with each other with
# environment variables. Yuck.
#
# The basic strategy is:
#
#  - Everyone exclusively *adds information* to relative-platform-specific
#    environment variables, like `NIX_TARGET_CFLAGS_COMPILE`, to communicate
#    with the wrapped binaries.
#
#  - The wrapped binaries will exclusively *read* cc-wrapper-derivation-specific
#    environment variables distinguished with with `infixSalt`, like
#    `NIX_@infixSalt@_CFLAGS_COMPILE`.
#
#  - `add-flags`, beyond its old task of reading extra flags stuck inside the
#    cc-wrapper derivation, will convert the relative-platform-specific
#    variables to cc-wrapper-derivation-specific variables. This conversion is
#    the only time all but one of the cc-wrapper-derivation-specific variables
#    are set.
#
# This ensures the flow of information is exclusive from
# relative-platform-specific variables to cc-wrapper-derivation-specific
# variables. This allows us to support the general case of a many--many relation
# between relative platforms and cc-wrapper derivations.
#
# For more details, read the individual files where the mechanisms used to
# accomplish this will be individually documented.
