      DCW-GMT is an enhancement to the original 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap
      of the world, available from the Princeton University Digital Map and
      Geospatial Information Center. It contains more state boundaries (the
      largest 8 countries are now represented) than the original data
      source. Information about DCW can be found on Wikipedia
      (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Chart_of_the_World). This data is
      for use by GMT, the Generic Mapping Tools.
