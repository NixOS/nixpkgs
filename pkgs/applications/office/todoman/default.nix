      Todoman is a simple, standards-based, cli todo (aka: task) manager. Todos
      are stored into icalendar files, which means you can sync them via CalDAV
      using, for example, vdirsyncer.

      Todos are read from individual ics files from the configured directory.
      This matches the vdir specification.  There’s support for the most common TODO
      features for now (summary, description, location, due date and priority) for
      now.  Runs on any Unix-like OS. It’s been tested on GNU/Linux, BSD and macOS.
      Unsupported fields may not be shown but are never deleted or altered.

      Todoman is part of the pimutils project
