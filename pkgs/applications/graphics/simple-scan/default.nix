      A really easy way to scan both documents and photos. You can crop out the
      bad parts of a photo and rotate it if it is the wrong way round. You can
      print your scans, export them to pdf, or save them in a range of image
      formats. Basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same backend as
      XSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will work and the
      interface is well tested.
