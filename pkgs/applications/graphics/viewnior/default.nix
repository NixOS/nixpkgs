      '' Viewnior is insipred by big projects like Eye of Gnome, because of it's
         usability and richness,and by GPicView, because of it's lightweight design and
         minimal interface. So here comes Viewnior - small and light, with no compromise
         with the quality of it's functions. The program is made with better integration
         in mind (follows Gnome HIG2).
