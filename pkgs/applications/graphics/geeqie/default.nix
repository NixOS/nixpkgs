        Geeqie is a lightweight GTK+ based image viewer for Unix like
        operating systems.  It features: EXIF, IPTC and XMP metadata
        browsing and editing interoperability; easy integration with other
        software; geeqie works on files and directories, there is no need to
        import images; fast preview for many raw image formats; tools for
        image comparison, sorting and managing photo collection.  Geeqie was
        initially based on GQview.
