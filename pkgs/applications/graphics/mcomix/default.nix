        MComix is an user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
        designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer.
        It reads images in ZIP, RAR, 7Zip or tar archives as well as plain image
        files. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings,
        and runs on both Linux and Windows.

        MComix is a fork of the Comix project, and aims to add bug fixes and
        stability improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late 2009.
