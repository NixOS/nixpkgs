    longDescription =
      '' GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program based on
         a feature extraction method.  It reads images in pbm (bitmap), pgm
         (greyscale) or ppm (color) formats and produces text in byte (8-bit)
         or UTF-8 formats.

         Also includes a layout analyser able to separate the columns or
         blocks of text normally found on printed pages.

         Ocrad can be used as a stand-alone console application, or as a
         backend to other programs.
