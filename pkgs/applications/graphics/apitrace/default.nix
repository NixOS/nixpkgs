    # Since https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/60985, we add `/run-opengl-driver[-32]`
    # to the `RUNPATH` of dispatcher libraries `dlopen()` ing OpenGL drivers.
    # `RUNPATH` doesn't propagate throughout the whole application, but only
    # from the module performing the `dlopen()`.
    #
    # Apitrace wraps programs by running them with `LD_PRELOAD` pointing to `.so`
    # files in $out/lib/apitrace/wrappers.
    #
    # Theses wrappers effectively wrap the `dlopen()` calls from `libglvnd`
    # and other dispatcher libraries, and run `dlopen()`  by themselves.
    #
    # As `RUNPATH` doesn't propagate through the whole library, and they're now the
    # library doing the real `dlopen()`, they also need to have
    # `/run-opengl-driver[-32]` added to their `RUNPATH`.
    #
    # To stay simple, we add paths for 32 and 64 bits unconditionally.
    # This doesn't have an impact on closure size, and if the 32 bit drivers
    # are not available, that folder is ignored.
