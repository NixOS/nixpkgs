      Alchemy is an open drawing project aimed at exploring how we can sketch,
      draw, and create on computers in new ways. Alchemy isnâ€™t software for
      creating finished artwork, but rather a sketching environment that
      focuses on the absolute initial stage of the creation process.
      Experimental in nature, Alchemy lets you brainstorm visually to explore
      an expanded range of ideas and possibilities in a serendipitous way.
