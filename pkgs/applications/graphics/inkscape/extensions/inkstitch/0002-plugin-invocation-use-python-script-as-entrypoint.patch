Subject: [PATCH 2/4] plugin invocation: use python script as entrypoint

Ink/Stitch is invoked by calling a script with command line parameters.
Depending on the distribution format, this is bundled into a standalone
binary -- at least for vanilla Ink/Stitch. For the nix version, we
follow manual install, which does *not* bundle the file. Hence, the
generation is patched to treat this packaged install as manual install,
and to still refer to the python file.

To keep the patchset small, only an if statement is changed, with the
intent of only using the else path.
