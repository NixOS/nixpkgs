      Animbar lets you easily create your own animation on paper and
      transparancy. From a set of input images two output images are
      computed, that are printed one on paper and one on
      transparency. By moving the transparency over the paper you
      create a fascinating animation effect. This kind of animation
      technique is hundreds of years old and known under several
      names: picket fence animation, barrier grid animation, Moir√©
      animation, to name a few.
