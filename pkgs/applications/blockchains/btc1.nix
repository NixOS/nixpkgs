    longDescription= ''
      Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
      completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
      parties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
      with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

      btc1 is an implementation of a Bitcoin full node with segwit2x hard fork
      support.
