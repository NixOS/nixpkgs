      Wownero’s emission is capped and supply is finite. Wownero is a fairly
      launched coin with no premine. It’s not a fork of another blockchain. With
      its own genesis block there is no degradation of privacy caused by ring
      signatures using different participants for the same transaction outputs.
      Unlike opposing forks.
