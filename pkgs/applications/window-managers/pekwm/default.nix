    longDescription = ''
      pekwm is a window manager that once upon a time was based on the
      aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it no
      longer resembles aewm++ at all. It has a much expanded
      feature-set, including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or
      fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports
      keychains, and much more.      
      - Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldn't be
        noticed.
      - Very configurable, we all work and think in different ways.
      - Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things
        appear as they should when starting applications.
      - Chainable Keygrabber, usability for everyone.
