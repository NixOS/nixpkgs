    longDescription = ''
      Miriway is a starting point for creating a Wayland based desktop environment using Mir.

      At the core of Miriway is miriway-shell, a Mir based Wayland compositor that provides:

      - A "floating windows" window managament policy;
      - Support for Wayland (and via Xwayland) X11 applications;
      - Dynamic workspaces;
      - Additional Wayland support for "shell components" such as panels and docs; and,
      - Configurable shortcuts for launching standard apps such as launcher and terminal emulator.

      In addition to miriway-shell, Miriway has:

      - A "terminal emulator finder" script miriway-terminal, that works with most terminal emulators;
      - A launch script miriway to simplify starting Miriway;
      - A default configuration file miriway-shell.config; and,
      - A greeter configuration miriway.desktop so Miriway can be selected at login

      Miriway has been tested with shell components from several desktop environments and there are notes on
      enabling these in miriway-shell.config.
