      TinyWM is a tiny window manager that I created as an exercise in
      minimalism. It is also maybe helpful in learning some of the very basics
      of creating a window manager. It is only around 50 lines of C. There is
      also a Python version using python-xlib.

      It lets you do four basic things:

      - Move windows interactively with Alt+Button1 drag (left mouse button)
      - Resize windows interactively with Alt+Button3 drag (right mouse button)
      - Raise windows with Alt+F1 (not high on usability I know, but I needed a
        keybinding in there somewhere)
      - Focus windows with the mouse pointer (X does this on its own)
