      MLVWM or Macintosh-Like Virtual Window Manager,
      is an FVWM descendant created by Takashi Hasegawa
      in 1997 while studying at Nagoya University and
      was written entirely in the C programming language.
      As its name implies, it attempts to emulate the
      pre-Mac OS X Macintosh look and feel in its layout and window design.
