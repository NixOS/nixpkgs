      Fork of i3wm, a tiling window manager primarily targeted at advanced users
      and developers. Based on a tree as data structure, supports tiling,
      stacking, and tabbing layouts, handled dynamically, as well as floating
      windows. This fork adds a few features such as gaps between windows.
      Configured via plain text file. Multi-monitor. UTF-8 clean.
