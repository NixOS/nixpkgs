      Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, as well
      as a useful environment in and of itself.
      Out of the box, Weston provides a very basic desktop, or a full-featured
      environment for non-desktop uses such as automotive, embedded, in-flight,
      industrial, kiosks, set-top boxes and TVs. It also provides a library
      allowing other projects to build their own full-featured environments on
      top of Weston's core. A small suite of example or demo clients are also
      provided.
