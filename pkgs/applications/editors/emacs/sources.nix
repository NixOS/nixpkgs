            GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more. At its core
            is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming
            language with extensions to support text editing.

            The features of GNU Emacs include: content-sensitive editing modes,
            including syntax coloring, for a wide variety of file types including
            plain text, source code, and HTML; complete built-in documentation,
            including a tutorial for new users; full Unicode support for nearly all
            human languages and their scripts; highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp
            code or a graphical interface; a large number of extensions that add other
            functionality, including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger
            interface, calendar, and more. Many of these extensions are distributed
            with GNU Emacs; others are available separately.
