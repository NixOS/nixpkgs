      GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more. At its core
      is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming
      language with extensions to support text editing.

      The features of GNU Emacs include: content-sensitive editing modes,
      including syntax coloring, for a wide variety of file types including
      plain text, source code, and HTML; complete built-in documentation,
      including a tutorial for new users; full Unicode support for nearly all
      human languages and their scripts; highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp
      code or a graphical interface; a large number of extensions that add other
      functionality, including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger
      interface, calendar, and more. Many of these extensions are distributed
      with GNU Emacs; others are available separately.

      This release is built from Mitsuharu Yamamoto's patched source code
      tailored for macOS.
