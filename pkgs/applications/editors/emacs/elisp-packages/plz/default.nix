      plz is an HTTP library for Emacs. It uses curl as a backend, which avoids
      some of the issues with using Emacsâ€™s built-in url library. It supports
      both synchronous and asynchronous requests. Its API is intended to be
      simple, natural, and expressive. Its code is intended to be simple and
      well-organized. Every feature is tested against httpbin.org.
