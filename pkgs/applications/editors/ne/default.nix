      ne is a free (GPL'd) text editor based on the POSIX standard that runs
      (we hope) on almost any UN*X machine.  ne is easy to use for the beginner,
      but powerful and fully configurable for the wizard, and most sparing in its
      resource usage.  See the manual for some highlights of ne's features.
