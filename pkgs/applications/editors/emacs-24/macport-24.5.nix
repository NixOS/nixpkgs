      GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more.  At its
      core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp
      programming language with extensions to support text editing.

      The features of GNU Emacs include: content-sensitive editing modes,
      including syntax coloring, for a wide variety of file types including
      plain text, source code, and HTML; complete built-in documentation,
      including a tutorial for new users; full Unicode support for nearly all
      human languages and their scripts; highly customizable, using Emacs
      Lisp code or a graphical interface; a large number of extensions that
      add other functionality, including a project planner, mail and news
      reader, debugger interface, calendar, and more.  Many of these
      extensions are distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available
      separately.

      This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 24. This provides a native
      GUI support for Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.11. Note that Emacs 23 and later
      already contain the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for
      Mac OS X 10.4 and later. So if it is good enough for you, then you
      don't need to try this.
