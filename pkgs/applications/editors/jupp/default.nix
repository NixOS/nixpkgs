      This is the portable version of JOE's Own Editor, which is currently
      developed at sourceforge, licenced under the GNU General Public License,
      Version 1, using autoconf/automake. This version has been enhanced by
      several functions intended for programmers or other professional users,
      and has a lot of bugs fixed. It is based upon an older version of joe
      because these behave better overall.
