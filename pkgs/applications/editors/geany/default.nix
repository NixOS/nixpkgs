      Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
      It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages.
      Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME.
      Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.
      Some basic features of Geany:
      - Syntax highlighting
      - Code folding
      - Symbol name auto-completion
      - Construct completion/snippets
      - Auto-closing of XML and HTML tags
      - Call tips
      - Many supported filetypes including C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal (full list)
      - Symbol lists
      - Code navigation
      - Build system to compile and execute your code
      - Simple project management
      - Plugin interface
