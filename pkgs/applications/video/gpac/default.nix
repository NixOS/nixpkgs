      GPAC is an Open Source multimedia framework for research and academic purposes.
      The project covers different aspects of multimedia, with a focus on presentation
      technologies (graphics, animation and interactivity) and on multimedia packaging
      formats such as MP4.

      GPAC provides three sets of tools based on a core library called libgpac:

      A multimedia player, called Osmo4 / MP4Client,
      A multimedia packager, called MP4Box,
      And some server tools included in MP4Box and MP42TS applications.
