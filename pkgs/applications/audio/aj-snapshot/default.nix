    Aj-snapshot is a small program that can be used to make snapshots of the connections made between JACK and/or ALSA clients. 
    Because JACK can provide both audio and MIDI support to programs, aj-snapshot can store both types of connections for JACK. 
    ALSA, on the other hand, only provides routing facilities for MIDI clients. 
    You can also run aj-snapshot in daemon mode if you want to have your connections continually restored.
