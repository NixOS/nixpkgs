    longDescription = ''
      It allows for multiple simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your computer's available memory.
      The application is a standalone JACK client with an engine controllable via OSC and MIDI.
      It also includes a GUI which communicates with the engine via OSC (even over a network) for user-friendly control on a desktop.
      However, this kind of live performance looping tool is most effectively used via hardware (midi footpedals, etc)
      and the engine can be run standalone on a computer without a monitor.
