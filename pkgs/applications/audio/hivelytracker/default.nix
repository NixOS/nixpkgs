    longDescription = ''
      Hively Tracker is a tracker program based upon the AHX format created in
      the mid '90s by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively
      popular, and many songs were created and used in scene productions and
      games. AHX was designed to create a very SID-like sound on the Amiga.

      HivelyTracker can import and export modules and instruments in the AHX
      format, but it also improves on AHX in several ways and therefore has
      its own instrument and module formats.
