    longDescription = ''
       squishyball is a simple command-line utility for performing
       double-blind A/B, A/B/X or X/X/Y testing on the command line.
       The user specifies two input files to be compared and uses the
       keyboard during playback to flip between the randomized samples
       to perform on-the-fly compar‐ isons.  After a predetermined
       number of trials, squishyball prints the trial results to
       stdout and exits.  Results (stdout) may be redirected to a file
       without affecting interactive use of the terminal.

       squishyball can also be used to perform casual, non-randomized
       comparisons of groups of up to ten samples; this is the default
       mode of operation.
