      These are audio plugins in the LV2 format, developed for linux. Most are suitable for live use.
      This collection contains:
        * Cellular Automaton Synth - additive synthesizer, where 16 harmonics are added according to rules of elementary cellular automata
        * Envelope Follower - a fully featured envelope follower plugin
        * Hip2B - a distortion/destroyer plugin
        * cheap distortion - another distortion plugin, but this one I wanted to get it as light as possible
        * stuck - a clone of the electro-harmonix freeze
        * power cut - this effect is commonly called tape stop
        * power up - the opposite of the power cut
        * ewham - a whammy style pitchshifter
        * lushlife - a simulated double tracking plugin capable of everything from a thin beatle effect to thick lush choruses to weird outlandish effects
