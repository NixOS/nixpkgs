      LittleGPTracker (a.k.a 'The piggy', 'lgpt') is a music tracker optimised
      to run on portable game consoles. It is currently running on Game Park's
      GP2x & Caanoo, PSP, Dingoo, Windows, Mac OSX (intel/ppc) & Linux (Debian).

      It implements the user interface of littlesounddj, a very famous tracker
      for the Gameboy platform that has been tried and tested by many users over
      the years, leading to a little complex but yet extremely efficent way of
      working.

      Piggy currently supports 8 monophonic 16Bit/44.1Khz stereo sample playback
      channels. Additionally, the program can drive MIDI instruments (with the
      gp32 and gp2x a custom MIDI interface is required).
