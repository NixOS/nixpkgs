# As of 2.1, puddletag has started pinning versions of all dependencies that it
# was built against which is an issue as the chances of us having the exact same
# versions in nixpkgs are slim to none.
#
# There is a difference between explicit and implicit version requirements and
# we should be able to safely ignore the latter. Therefore use requirements.in
# which contains just the explicit version dependencies instead of
# requirements.txt.
#
# Additionally, we do need to override some of the explicit requirements through
# `overrideVersions`. While we technically run the risk of breaking something by
# ignoring the pinned versions, it's just something we will have to accept
# unless we want to vendor those versions.
