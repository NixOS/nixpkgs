      FAUST (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming
      language specifically designed for real-time signal processing
      and synthesis. FAUST targets high-performance signal processing
      applications and audio plug-ins for a variety of platforms and
      standards.
      The Faust compiler translates DSP specifications into very
      efficient C++ code. Thanks to the notion of architecture,
      FAUST programs can be easily deployed on a large variety of
      audio platforms and plugin formats (jack, alsa, ladspa, maxmsp,
      puredata, csound, supercollider, pure, vst, coreaudio) without
      any change to the FAUST code.
      This package has just the compiler. Install faust for the full
      set of faust2somethingElse tools.
