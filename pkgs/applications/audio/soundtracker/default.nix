      SoundTracker is a pattern-oriented music editor (similar to the DOS
      program 'FastTracker'). Samples are lined up on tracks and patterns
      which are then arranged to a song. Supported module formats are XM and
      MOD; the player code is the one from OpenCP. A basic sample recorder
      and editor is also included.
