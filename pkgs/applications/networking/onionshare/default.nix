      OnionShare is an open source tool for securely and anonymously sending
      and receiving files using Tor onion services. It works by starting a web
      server directly on your computer and making it accessible as an
      unguessable Tor web address that others can load in Tor Browser to
      download files from you, or upload files to you. It doesn't require
      setting up a separate server, using a third party file-sharing service,
      or even logging into an account.

      Unlike services like email, Google Drive, DropBox, WeTransfer, or nearly
      any other way people typically send files to each other, when you use
      OnionShare you don't give any companies access to the files that you're
      sharing. So long as you share the unguessable web address in a secure way
      (like pasting it in an encrypted messaging app), no one but you and the
      person you're sharing with can access the files.
