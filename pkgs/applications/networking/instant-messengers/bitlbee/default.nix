      BitlBee brings IM (instant messaging) to IRC clients.  It's a
      great solution for people who have an IRC client running all the
      time and don't want to run an additional MSN/AIM/whatever
      client.

      BitlBee currently supports the following IM networks/protocols:
      XMPP/Jabber (including Google Talk), MSN Messenger, Yahoo!
      Messenger, AIM and ICQ.
