Yes, that would be fine.  As long as you are not renting servers or selling
TeamSpeak then you are more than welcome to distribute it.

Thank you,

Subject: teamspeak on nix?

Hello,

nix is very young software distribution system (http://nix.cs.uu.nl/)
I'd like to ask wether you permit us to add teamspeak (server/ client?)

Sincerly
