Yes, that would be fine.  As long as you are not renting servers or selling
TeamSpeak then you are more than welcome to distribute it.

Thank you,

Hello,

nix is very young software distribution system (http://nix.cs.uu.nl/)
I'd like to ask wether you permit us to add teamspeak (server/ client?)

Sincerly
