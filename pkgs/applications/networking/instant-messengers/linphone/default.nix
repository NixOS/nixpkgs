# How to update Linphone? (The Qt desktop app)
#
# Belledonne Communications (BC), the company making Linphone, has split the
# project into several sub-projects that they maintain, plus some third-party
# dependencies that they also extend with commits of their own, specific to
# Linphone and not (yet?) upstreamed.
#
# All of this is organised in a Software Development Kit (SDK) meta-repository
# with git submodules to pin all those repositories into a coherent whole.
#
# The Linphone Qt desktop app uses this SDK as submodule as well.
#
# So, in order to update the desktop app to a new release, one has to follow
# the submodule chain and update the corresponding derivations here, in nixpkgs,
# with the corresponding version number (or commit hash)

  # The default install phase fails because the paths are somehow messed up in

  #
  #   CMake Error at cmake_builder/linphone_package/cmake_install.cmake:49 (file):
  #     file INSTALL cannot find
  #     "/build/linphone-desktop-.../build/linphone-sdk/desktop//nix/store/.../bin":
  #     No such file or directory.
  #
  # If someone is able to figure out how to fix that, great. For now, just
  # trying to pick all the relevant files to the output.
  #
  # Also, the exec path in linphone.desktop file remains invalid, pointing to
  # the build directory, after the whole nix build process. So, let's use sed to
  # manually fix that path.
  #
  # In order to find mediastreamer plugins, mediastreamer package was patched to
  # support an environment variable pointing to the plugin directory. Set that
  # environment variable by wrapping the Linphone executable.
  #
  # Also, some grammar files needed to be copied too from some dependencies. I
  # suppose if one define a dependency in such a way that its share directory is
  # found, then this copying would be unnecessary. These missing grammar files
  # were discovered when linphone crashed at startup and it was run with
  # --verbose flag. Instead of actually copying these files, create symlinks.
  #
  # It is quite likely that there are some other files still missing and
  # Linphone will randomly crash when it tries to access those files. Then,
  # those just need to be copied manually below.
