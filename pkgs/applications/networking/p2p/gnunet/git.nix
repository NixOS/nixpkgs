    longDescription = ''
      GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that
      does not use any centralized or otherwise trusted services.  A
      first service implemented on top of the networking layer
      allows anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing.  Anonymity
      is provided by making messages originating from a peer
      indistinguishable from messages that the peer is routing.  All
      peers act as routers and use link-encrypted connections with
      stable bandwidth utilization to communicate with each other.
      GNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate
      resources.  Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with
      respect to resource usage; peers that contribute to the
      network are rewarded with better service.
