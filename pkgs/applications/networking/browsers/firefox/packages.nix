        This is a version of TorBrowser with bundle-related patches
        reverted.

        I.e. it's a variant of Firefox with less fingerprinting and
        some isolation features you can't get with any extensions.

        Or, alternatively, a variant of TorBrowser that works like any
        other UNIX program and doesn't expect you to run it from a
        bundle.

        It will use your default Firefox profile if you're not careful
        even! Be careful!

        It will clash with firefox binary if you install both. But its
        not a problem since you should run browsers in separate
        users/VMs anyway.

        Create new profile by starting it as

        $ firefox -ProfileManager

        and then configure it to use your tor instance.
