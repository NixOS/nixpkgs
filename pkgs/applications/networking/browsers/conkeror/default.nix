      Conkeror is a keyboard-oriented, highly-customizable, highly-extensible
      web browser based on Mozilla XULRunner, written mainly in JavaScript,
      and inspired by exceptional software such as Emacs and vi. Conkeror
      features a sophisticated keyboard system, allowing users to run commands
      and interact with content in powerful and novel ways. It is
      self-documenting, featuring a powerful interactive help system.
