      Reads an email file from either STDIN or from a file passed as the first
      argument, digests it and outputs it to STDOUT in a more human readable
      format. This means only From, To, Cc, Bcc, Date and Subject headers are
      kept and these are decoded and of all the parts only text/plain is returned.
