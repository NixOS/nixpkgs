# Even though pCloud Drive is redistributed as a plug-n-play AppImage, it
# requires a little bit more love because of the way Nix launches those types
# of applications.
#
# What Nix does, simplifying a bit, is that it extracts an AppImage and starts
# it via buildFHSUserEnv - this is totally fine for majority of apps, but makes
# it by-design *impossible* to launch SUID wrappers [^1]; in case of pCloud,
# it's fusermount.
# (so pCloud starts, but silently fails to mount the FUSE drive.)
#
# To overcome this issue, we're manually extracting the AppImage and then treat
# it as if it was a regular, good-ol' application requiring some standard path
# fixes.
