    longDescription = ''
      The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for
      the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of
      computers using a simple programming model. It is designed to
      scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each
      offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on
      hardware to deliver high-avaiability, the library itself is
      designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer,
      so delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a cluster of
      computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
