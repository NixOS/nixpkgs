# k3s is a kinda weird derivation. One of the main points of k3s is the
# simplicity of it being one binary that can perform several tasks.
# However, when you have a good package manager (like nix), that doesn't
# actually make much of a difference; you don't really care if it's one binary
# or 10 since with a good package manager, installing and running it is
# identical.
# Since upstream k3s packages itself as one large binary with several
# "personalities" (in the form of subcommands like 'k3s agent' and 'k3s
# kubectl'), it ends up being easiest to mostly mimic upstream packaging, with
# some exceptions.
# K3s also carries patches to some packages (such as containerd and cni
# plugins), so we intentionally use the k3s versions of those binaries for k3s,
# even if the upstream version of those binaries exist in nixpkgs already. In
# the end, that means we have a thick k3s binary that behaves like the upstream
# one for the most part.
# However, k3s also bundles several pieces of unpatched software, from the
# strongswan vpn software, to iptables, to socat, conntrack, busybox, etc.
# Those pieces of software we entirely ignore upstream's handling of, and just
# make sure they're in the path if desired.

  # Stage 1 of the k3s build:
  # Let's talk about how k3s is structured.
  # One of the ideas of k3s is that there's the single "k3s" binary which can
  # do everything you need, from running a k3s server, to being a worker node,
  # to running kubectl.
  # The way that actually works is that k3s is a single go binary that contains
  # a bunch of bindata that it unpacks at runtime into directories (either the
  # user's home directory or /var/lib/rancher if run as root).
  # This bindata includes both binaries and configuration.
  # In order to let nixpkgs do all its autostripping/patching/etc, we split this into two derivations.
  # First, we build all the binaries that get packed into the thick k3s binary
  # (and output them from one derivation so they'll all be suitably patched up).
  # Then, we bundle those binaries into our thick k3s binary and use that as
  # the final single output.
  # This approach was chosen because it ensures the bundled binaries all are
  # correctly built to run with nix (we can lean on the existing buildGoModule
  # stuff), and we can again lean on that tooling for the final k3s binary too.
  # Other alternatives would be to manually run the
  # strip/patchelf/remove-references step ourselves in the installPhase of the
  # derivation when we've built all the binaries, but haven't bundled them in
  # with generated bindata yet.
