      8086tiny is a tiny, open-source (MIT), portable (little-endian hosts)
      Intel PC emulator, powerful enough to run DOS, Windows 3.0, Excel, MS
      Flight Simulator, AutoCAD, Lotus 1-2-3, and similar applications. 8086tiny
      emulates a "late 80's era" PC XT-type machine.

      8086tiny is based on an IOCCC 2013 winning entry. In fact that is the
      "unobfuscated" version :)
