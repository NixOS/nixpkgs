      Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory
      Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for
      Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically used
      for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.
      Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a device
      associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regions
      need to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logic
      establishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting in
      such mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have been
      removed again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memory
      regions which they aren't supposed to have access to.

      When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed
      through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective
      guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing
      internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration
      cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far
      missing.
