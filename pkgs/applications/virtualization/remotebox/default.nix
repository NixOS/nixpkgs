      VirtualBox is traditionally considered to be a virtualization solution
      aimed at the desktop. While it is certainly possible to install
      VirtualBox on a server, it offers few remote management features beyond
      using the vboxmanage command line.
      RemoteBox aims to fill this gap by providing a graphical VirtualBox
      client which is able to manage a VirtualBox server installation.
