      CDEmu consists of:

      - a kernel module implementing a virtual drive-controller
      - libmirage which is a software library for interpreting optical disc images
      - a daemon which emulates the functionality of an optical drive+disc
      - textmode and GTK clients for controlling the emulator
      - an image analyzer to view the structure of image files

      Optical media emulated by CDemu can be mounted within Linux. Automounting is also allowed.
