      blink is a virtual machine that runs x86-64-linux programs on different operating systems and hardware architectures. It's designed to do the same thing as the qemu-x86_64 command, except that
      - blink is much smaller in size than qemu-x86_64
      - blink will run your Linux binaries on any POSIX platform, whereas qemu-x86_64 only supports Linux
      - blink goes 2x faster than qemu-x86_64 on some benchmarks, such as SSE integer / floating point math. Blink is also faster at running ephemeral programs such as compilers
