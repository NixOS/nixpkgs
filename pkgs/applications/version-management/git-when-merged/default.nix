      If you use standard Git workflows, then you create a feature
      branch for each feature that you are working on. When the feature
      is complete, you merge it into your master branch. You might even
      have sub-feature branches that are merged into a feature branch
      before the latter is merged.

      In such a workflow, the first-parent history of master consists
      mainly of merges of feature branches into the mainline. git
      when-merged can be used to ask, "When (and why) was commit C
      merged into the current branch?"
