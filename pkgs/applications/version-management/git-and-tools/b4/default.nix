      This is a helper utility to work with patches made available via a
      public-inbox archive like lore.kernel.org. It is written to make it
      easier to participate in a patch-based workflows, like those used in
      the Linux kernel development.

      The name "b4" was chosen for ease of typing and because B-4 was the
      precursor to Lore and Data in the Star Trek universe.
