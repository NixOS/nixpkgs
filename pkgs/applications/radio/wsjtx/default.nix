      WSJT-X implements communication protocols or "modes" called FT4, FT8, JT4,
      JT9, JT65, QRA64, ISCAT, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one called Echo for
      detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from the Moon.
      These modes were all designed for making reliable, confirmed ham radio
      contacts under extreme weak-signal conditions.
