      # 1) From Sage's Trac. Contains all release tags (like "9.4") and all developer
      # branches (wip patches from tickets), but exports each commit as a separate
      # patch, so merge commits can lead to conflicts. Used if squashed == false.
      #
      # 2) From GitHub's sagemath/sage repo. This lets us use a GH feature that allows
      # us to choose between a .patch file, with one patch per commit, or a .diff file,
      # which squashes all commits into a single diff. This is used if squashed ==
      # true. This repo has all release tags. However, it has no developer branches, so
      # this option can't be used if a change wasn't yet shipped in a (possibly beta)
      # release.
      #
      # 3) From GitHub's sagemath/sagetrac-mirror repo. Mirrors all developer branches,
      # but has no release tags. The only use case not covered by 1 or 2 is when we need
      # to apply a patch from an open ticket that contains merge commits.
      #
      # Item 3 could cover all use cases if the sagemath/sagetrack-mirror repo had
      # release tags, but it requires a sha instead of a release number in "base", which
      # is inconvenient.
