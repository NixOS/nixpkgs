      Pynac -- "Python is Not a CAS" is a modified version of Ginac that
      replaces the depency of GiNaC on CLN by a dependency instead of Python.
      It is a lite version of GiNaC as well, not implementing all the features
      of the full GiNaC, and it is *only* meant to be used as a Python library.
