    longDescription = ''
       PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast
       computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory,
       elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful
       functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices,
       polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of
       transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow
       for faster computations.

       Originally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Universit√©
       Bordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim
       Belabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.

       - PARI is a C library, allowing fast computations.  
       - gp is an easy-to-use interactive shell giving access to the
          PARI functions.
       - GP is the name of gp's scripting language.
       - gp2c, the GP-to-C compiler, combines the best of both worlds 
          by compiling GP scripts to the C language and transparently loading 
          the resulting functions into gp. (gp2c-compiled scripts will typically
          run 3 or 4 times faster.) gp2c currently only understands a subset
           of the GP language.
