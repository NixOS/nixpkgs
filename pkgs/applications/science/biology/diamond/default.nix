      DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches, designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key features are:
      - Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-10,000x speed of BLAST.
      - Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
      - Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard desktops or laptops.
      - Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML, as well as taxonomic classification.
