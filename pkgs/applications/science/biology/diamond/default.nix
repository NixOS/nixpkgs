    longDescription = ''
      A sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA
      searches and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST
      software tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as
      DNA-protein search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs
      and assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000.
