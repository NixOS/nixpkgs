      MultiQC is a tool to create a single report with interactive plots for multiple bioinformatics analyses across many samples.

      Reports are generated by scanning given directories for recognised log files.
      These are parsed and a single HTML report is generated summarising the statistics
      for all logs found. MultiQC reports can describe multiple analysis steps and
      large numbers of samples within a single plot, and multiple analysis tools making
      it ideal for routine fast quality control.

      A very large number of Bioinformatics tools are supported by MultiQC. Please see the MultiQC website for a [complete list](https://multiqc.info/modules/).
      MultiQC can also easily parse data from custom scripts, if correctly formatted / configured - a feature called [Custom Content](https://multiqc.info/docs/custom_content/).

      More modules are being written all of the time. Please suggest any ideas as a new
      [issue](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/issues) _(please include example log files)_.
