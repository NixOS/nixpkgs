      Snakemake is a workflow management system that aims to reduce the complexity of
      creating workflows by providing a fast and comfortable execution environment,
      together with a clean and readable specification language in Python style. Snakemake
      workflows are essentially Python scripts extended by declarative code to define
      rules. Rules describe how to create output files from input files.
