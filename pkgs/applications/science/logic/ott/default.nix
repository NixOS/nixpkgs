      Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and
      calculi. It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and
      semantics, in a concise and readable ASCII notation that is close to
      what one would write in informal mathematics. It generates LaTeX to
      build a typeset version of the definition, and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle
      versions of the definition. Additionally, it can be run as a filter,
      taking a LaTeX/Coq/Isabelle/HOL source file with embedded (symbolic)
      terms of the defined language, parsing them and replacing them by
      target-system terms.
