      DRAT-trim is a satisfiability proof checking and trimming
      utility designed to validate proofs for all known satisfiability
      solving and preprocessing techniques.  DRAT-trim can also emit
      trimmed formulas, optimized proofs, and TraceCheck+ dependency
      graphs.

      DRAT-trim has been used as part of the judging process in the
      annual SAT Competition in recent years, in order to check
      competing SAT solvers' work when they claim that a SAT instance
      is unsatisfiable.
