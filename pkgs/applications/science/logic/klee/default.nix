    longDescription = ''
      KLEE is a symbolic virtual machine built on top of the LLVM compiler
      infrastructure. Currently, there are two primary components:

      1. The core symbolic virtual machine engine; this is responsible for
         executing LLVM bitcode modules with support for symbolic values. This
         is comprised of the code in lib/.

      2. A POSIX/Linux emulation layer oriented towards supporting uClibc, with
         additional support for making parts of the operating system environment
         symbolic.

      Additionally, there is a simple library for replaying computed inputs on
      native code (for closed programs). There is also a more complicated
      infrastructure for replaying the inputs generated for the POSIX/Linux
      emulation layer, which handles running native programs in an environment
      that matches a computed test input, including setting up files, pipes,
      environment variables, and passing command line arguments.
