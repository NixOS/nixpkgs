      Electrum-LTC is a simple, but powerful Litecoin wallet. A twelve-word
      security passphrase (or “seed”) leaves intruders stranded and your peace
      of mind intact. Keep it on paper, or in your head... and never worry
      about losing your litecoins to theft or hardware failure. No waiting, no
      lengthy blockchain downloads and no syncing to the network.
