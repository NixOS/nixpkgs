        Zathura is a highly customizable and functional PDF viewer based on the
        poppler rendering library and the gtk+ toolkit. The idea behind zathura
        is an application that provides a minimalistic and space saving interface
        as well as an easy usage that mainly focuses on keyboard interaction.
