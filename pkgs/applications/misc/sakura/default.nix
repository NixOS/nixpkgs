      sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and VTE. It's a terminal
      emulator with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop
      installed to have a decent terminal emulator. Current terminal emulators
      based on VTE are gnome-terminal, XFCE Terminal, TermIt and a small
      sample program included in the vte sources. The differences between
      sakura and the last one are that it uses a notebook to provide several
      terminals in one window and adds a contextual menu with some basic
      options. No more no less.
