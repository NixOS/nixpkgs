      fsv (pronounced eff-ess-vee) is a file system visualizer in cyberspace.
      It lays out files and directories in three dimensions, geometrically
      representing the file system hierarchy to allow visual overview
      and analysis. fsv can visualize a modest home directory, a workstation's
      hard drive, or any arbitrarily large collection of files, limited only
      by the host computer's memory and graphics hardware.
