      Armory is the most secure and full featured solution available for users
      and institutions to generate and store Bitcoin private keys. This means
      users never have to trust the Armory team and can use it with the Glacier
      Protocol. Satoshi would be proud!

      Users are empowered with multiple encrypted Bitcoin wallets and permanent
      one-time ‘paper backups’. Armory pioneered cold storage and distributed
      multi-signature. Bitcoin cold storage is a system for securely storing
      Bitcoins on a completely air-gapped offline computer.

      Maintainer's note: The original authors at https://bitcoinarmory.com/
      discontinued development. I elected instead to package GitHub user
      @goatpig's fork, as it's the most active, at time of this writing.
