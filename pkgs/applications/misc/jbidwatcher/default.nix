    longDescription = ''
      A Java-based application allowing you to monitor auctions you're
      not part of, submit bids, snipe (bid at the last moment), and
      otherwise track your auction-site experience. It includes
      adult-auction management, MANY currencies (pound, dollar (US,
      Canada, Australian, and New Taiwanese) and euro, presently),
      drag-and-drop of auction URLs, an original, unique and powerful
      'multisniping' feature, a relatively nice UI, and is known to work
      cleanly under Linux, Windows, Solaris, and MacOSX from the same
      binary.
