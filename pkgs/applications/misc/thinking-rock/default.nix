     the tr.sh script does use the coreutils tr itself
     That's why I've renamed the wrapper and called it thinkingrock
     However you may not rename the bin/tr script cause it will notice and throw an
     "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Malformed branding token: thinkingrock"
     exception. I hope that's fine
