            mysql or postgresql dbs, or Jenkins, please contact the maintainer.

      Bugs which affect this software packaged in Nixpkgs:

      1. The package must disable checks, because they are lacking the qt env.
         (see pkg source and https://discourse.nixos.org/t/qt-plugin-path-unset-in-test-phase/)
      2. There is a segfault on exit. Not a real problem, according to debug log, everything
         shuts down correctly. Maybe related to https://forums.openlp.org/discussion/3620/crash-on-exit.
         Plan: Wait for OpenLP-3, since it is already in beta 1
         (2021-02-09; news: https://openlp.org/blog/).
