      Solaar is a Linux device manager for Logitechâ€™s Unifying Receiver
      peripherals. It is able to pair/unpair devices to the receiver, and for
      most devices read battery status.

      It comes in two flavors, command-line and GUI. Both are able to list the
      devices paired to a Unifying Receiver, show detailed info for each
      device, and also pair/unpair supported devices with the receiver.

      To be able to use it, make sure you have access to /dev/hidraw* files.
