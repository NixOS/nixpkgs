      Programs

      doz --- a converter; converts decimal numbers into dozenal. Accepts
         input in standard or exponential notation (i.e., "1492.2" or "1.4922e3").
      dec --- a converter; converts dozenal numbers into decimal. Accepts input
         in standard or exponential notation (i.e., "X44;4" or "X;444e2").
      dozword --- converts a dozenal number (integers only) into words,
         according to the Pendlebury system.
      dozdc --- a full-featured scientific calculator which works in the
         dozenal base. RPN command line.
      tgmconv --- a converter for all standard measurements; converts to and
         from TGM, Imperial, customary, and SI metric.
      dozpret --- a pretty-printer for dozenal numbers; inserts spacing (or
         other characters) as desired, and can also transform transdecimal digits
         from 'X' to 'E' into any character or sequence of characters desired.
      dozdate --- a more-or-less drop-in replacement for GNU and BSD date, it
         outputs the date and time in dozenal, as well as containing some TGM
         extensions.
      dozstring --- a simple byte converter; absorbs a string either from
         standard input or a command line argument, leaving it identical but
         for the numbers, which it converts into dozenal. Options for padding
         and for not converting specific numbers.
      doman --- a converter which takes a dozenal integer and
         emits its equivalent in a non-place-value system, such as
         Roman numerals.  Arbitrary ranks and symbols may be used.
         Defaults to dozenal Roman numerals.
