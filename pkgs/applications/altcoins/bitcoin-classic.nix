    longDescription= ''
      Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
      completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
      parties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
      with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

      We call our code repository Bitcoin Classic. It starts as a one-feature patch
      to bitcoin-core that increases the blocksize limit to 2 MB. We will have
      ports for master and 0.11.2, so that miners and businesses can upgrade to 2 MB
      blocks from any recent bitcoin software version they run. In the future we will
      continue to release updates that are in line with Satoshiâ€™s whitepaper &
      vision, and are agreed upon by the community.
