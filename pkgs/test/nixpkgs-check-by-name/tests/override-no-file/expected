- Because pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `pkgs.nonDerivation` must be defined like

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the first `callPackage` argument is not a path. See the definition in all-packages.nix:2:

    nonDerivation = self.callPackage ({ someDrv }: someDrv) { };

This PR introduces the problems listed above. Please fix them before merging, otherwise the base branch would break.
