- Because pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `pkgs.nonDerivation` must be defined like

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, it isn't defined that way. See the definition in all-packages.nix:2

    nonDerivation = self.someDrv;

This PR introduces the problems listed above. Please fix them before merging, otherwise the base branch would break.
