/*
This file returns a mocked version of Nixpkgs' default.nix for testing purposes.
It does not depend on Nixpkgs itself for the sake of simplicity.

It takes one attribute as an argument:
- `root`: The root of Nixpkgs to read other files from, including:
  - `./pkgs/by-name`: The `pkgs/by-name` directory to test
  - `./all-packages.nix`: A file containing an overlay to mirror the real `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`.
    This allows adding overrides on top of the auto-called packages in `pkgs/by-name`.

It returns a Nixpkgs-like function that can be auto-called and evaluates to an attribute set.
