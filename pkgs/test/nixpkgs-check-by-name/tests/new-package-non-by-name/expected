- Attribute `pkgs.new1` is a new top-level package using `pkgs.callPackage ... { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/ne/new1/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` in all-packages.nix is needed anymore.

- Attribute `pkgs.new2` is a new top-level package using `pkgs.callPackage ./without-config.nix { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/ne/new2/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` in all-packages.nix is needed anymore.

- Attribute `pkgs.new3` is a new top-level package using `pkgs.callPackage ... { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/ne/new3/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is not `{ }`, the manual `callPackage` in all-packages.nix is still needed.

- Attribute `pkgs.new4` is a new top-level package using `pkgs.callPackage ./with-config.nix { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/ne/new4/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is not `{ }`, the manual `callPackage` in all-packages.nix is still needed.
