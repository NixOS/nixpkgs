pkgs.a: This attribute is manually defined (most likely in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix), which is only allowed if the definition is of the form `pkgs.callPackage pkgs/by-name/a/a/package.nix { ... }` with a non-empty second argument.
pkgs.b: This is a new top-level package of the form `callPackage ... { }`. Please define it in pkgs/by-name/b/b/package.nix instead. See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details. Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` (e.g. in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`) is needed anymore.
pkgs.c: This attribute is manually defined (most likely in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix), which is only allowed if the definition is of the form `pkgs.callPackage pkgs/by-name/c/c/package.nix { ... }` with a non-empty second argument.
pkgs.d: This is a new top-level package of the form `callPackage ... { }`. Please define it in pkgs/by-name/d/d/package.nix instead. See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details. Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` (e.g. in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`) is needed anymore.
