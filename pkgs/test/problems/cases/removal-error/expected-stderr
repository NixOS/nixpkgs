error: Package ‘a-0’ in /nix/store/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-default.nix:11 has the following problems that must be acknowledged: [ "removal" ], refusing to evaluate.


Package problems:

- removal: This package has been abandoned upstream and will be removed.

You can use it anyway by ignoring its problems, using one of the
following methods:

a) For `nixos-rebuild` you can add "warn" or "ignore" entries to
  `nixpkgs.config.problems.handlers` inside configuration.nix,
  like this:

    {
      nixpkgs.config.problems.handlers = {
        a.removal = "warn";
      };
    }

b) For `nix-env`, `nix-build`, `nix-shell` or any other Nix command you can add
  "warn" or "ignore" to `problems.handlers` in
  ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix, like this:

    {
      problems.handlers = {
        a.removal = "warn";
      };
    }
