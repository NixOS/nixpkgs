      Fully asynchronous C implementation of the Raft consensus protocol
    '';
    longDescription = ''
      The library has modular design: its core part implements only the core
      Raft algorithm logic, in a fully platform independent way. On top of
      that, a pluggable interface defines the I/O implementation for networking
      (send/receive RPC messages) and disk persistence (store log entries and
      snapshots).
