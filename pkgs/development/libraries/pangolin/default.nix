    longDescription = ''
      Pangolin is a lightweight portable rapid development library for managing
      OpenGL display / interaction and abstracting video input. At its heart is
      a simple OpenGl viewport manager which can help to modularise 3D
      visualisation without adding to its complexity, and offers an advanced
      but intuitive 3D navigation handler. Pangolin also provides a mechanism
      for manipulating program variables through config files and ui
      integration, and has a flexible real-time plotter for visualising
      graphical data.
