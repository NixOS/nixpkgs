  # The generated C++ code uses static initializers which mutate a global data
  # structure. This causes problems for an executable when:
  #
  # 1) it dynamically links to two libs, both of which contain generated C++ for
  #    the same proto file, and
  # 2) the two aforementioned libs both dynamically link to libprotobuf.
  #
  # One solution is to statically link libprotobuf, that way the global
  # variables are not shared; in fact, this is necessary for the python Mesos
  # binding to not crash, as the python lib contains two C extensions which
  # both refer to the same proto schema.
