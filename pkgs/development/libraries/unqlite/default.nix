      UnQLite is a in-process software library which implements a
      self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional NoSQL
      database engine. UnQLite is a document store database similar to MongoDB,
      Redis, CouchDB etc. as well a standard Key/Value store similar to
      BerkeleyDB, LevelDB, etc.

      UnQLite is an embedded NoSQL (Key/Value store and Document-store) database
      engine. Unlike most other NoSQL databases, UnQLite does not have a
      separate server process. UnQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary
      disk files. A complete database with multiple collections, is contained in
      a single disk file. The database file format is cross-platform, you can
      freely copy a database between 32-bit and 64-bit systems or between
      big-endian and little-endian architectures.
