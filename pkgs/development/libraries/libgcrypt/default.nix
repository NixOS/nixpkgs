    longDescription = ''
      Libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library based on
      the code from GnuPG.  It provides functions for all
      cryptographic building blocks: symmetric ciphers, hash
      algorithms, MACs, public key algorithms, large integer
      functions, random numbers and a lot of supporting functions.
