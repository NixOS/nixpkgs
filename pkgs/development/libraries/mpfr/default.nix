    longDescription = ''
      The GNU MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision
      floating-point computations with correct rounding.  MPFR is
      based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

      The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for
      multiple-precision floating-point computation which is both
      efficient and has a well-defined semantics.  It copies the good
      ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision
      floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).
