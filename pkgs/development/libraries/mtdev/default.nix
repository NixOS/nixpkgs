      The mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of
      kernel MT events to the slotted type B protocol. The events put into
      mtdev may be from any MT device, specifically type A without contact
      tracking, type A with contact tracking, or type B with contact tracking.
      See the kernel documentation for further details.
