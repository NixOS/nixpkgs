      Libidn2 is believed to be a complete IDNA2008 and TR46 implementation,
      but has yet to be as extensively used as the IDNA2003 Libidn library.

      The installed C library libidn2 is dual-licensed under LGPLv3+|GPLv2+,
      while the rest of the package is GPLv3+.  See the file COPYING for
      detailed information.
