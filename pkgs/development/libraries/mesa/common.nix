      The Mesa project began as an open-source implementation of the OpenGL
      specification - a system for rendering interactive 3D graphics. Over the
      years the project has grown to implement more graphics APIs, including
      OpenGL ES (versions 1, 2, 3), OpenCL, OpenMAX, VDPAU, VA API, XvMC, and
      Vulkan.  A variety of device drivers allows the Mesa libraries to be used
      in many different environments ranging from software emulation to
      complete hardware acceleration for modern GPUs.
