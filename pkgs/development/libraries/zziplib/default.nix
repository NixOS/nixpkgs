    longDescription = ''
      The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the ability
      to easily extract data from files archived in a single zip
      file.  Applications can bundle files into a single zip archive and
      access them.  The implementation is based only on the (free) subset of
      compression with the zlib algorithm which is actually used by the
      zip/unzip tools.
