    longDescription = ''
      The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code
      which provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or
      polygons and SDL_rotozoom which implemented a interpolating
      rotozoomer for SDL surfaces.

      The current components of the SDL_gfx library are:

          * Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)
          * Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h)
          * Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h)
          * MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h)
          * Custom Blit functions (SDL_gfxBlitFunc.h)

      The library is backwards compatible to the above mentioned
      code. Its is written in plain C and can be used in C++ code.
