    longDescription = ''
      BearSSL is an implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol (RFC 5246)
      written in C. It aims at offering the following features:

      * Be correct and secure. In particular, insecure protocol versions and
        choices of algorithms are not supported, by design; cryptographic
        algorithm implementations are constant-time by default.

      * Be small, both in RAM and code footprint. For instance, a minimal
        server implementation may fit in about 20 kilobytes of compiled code
        and 25 kilobytes of RAM.

      * Be highly portable. BearSSL targets not only “big” operating systems
        like Linux and Windows, but also small embedded systems and even
        special contexts like bootstrap code.

      * Be feature-rich and extensible. SSL/TLS has many defined cipher
        suites and extensions; BearSSL should implement most of them, and
        allow extra algorithm implementations to be added afterwards,
        possibly from third parties.
