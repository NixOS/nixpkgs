    longDescription = ''
      Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
      devices.  Currently supported output targets include the X
      Window System, Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF,
      and SVG file output.  Experimental backends include OpenGL
      (through glitz), XCB, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.

      Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output
      media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration
      when available (e.g., through the X Render Extension).
