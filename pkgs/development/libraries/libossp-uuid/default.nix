      ''
        OSSP uuid is a ISO-C:1999 application programming interface
        (API) and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the
        generation of DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and RFC 4122
        compliant Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). It supports
        DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node based),
        version 3 (name based, MD5), version 4 (random number based)
        and version 5 (name based, SHA-1). Additional API bindings are
        provided for the languages ISO-C++:1998, Perl:5 and
        PHP:4/5. Optional backward compatibility exists for the ISO-C
        DCE-1.1 and Perl Data::UUID APIs.

        UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high
        likelihood of uniqueness over space and time and are
        computationally difficult to guess. They are globally unique
        identifiers which can be locally generated without contacting
        a global registration authority. UUIDs are intended as unique
        identifiers for both mass tagging objects with an extremely
        short lifetime and to reliably identifying very persistent
        objects across a network.
