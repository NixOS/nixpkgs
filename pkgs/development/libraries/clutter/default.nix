    longDescription =
      '' Clutter is free software library for creating fast, compelling,
         portable, and dynamic graphical user interfaces.  It is a core part
         of MeeGo, and is supported by the open source community.  Its
         development is sponsored by Intel.

         Clutter uses OpenGL for rendering (and optionally OpenGL|ES for use
         on mobile and embedded platforms), but wraps an easy to use,
         efficient, flexible API around GL's complexity.

         Clutter enforces no particular user interface style, but provides a
         rich, generic foundation for higher-level toolkits tailored to
         specific needs.
