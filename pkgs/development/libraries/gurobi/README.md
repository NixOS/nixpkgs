The Gurobi Optimizer is a commercial optimization solver for linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), quadratically constrained programming (QCP), mixed integer linear programming (MILP), mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), and mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP).

The solver is free for academic use, and licenses may easily be obtained from Gurobi's [web site](http://www.gurobi.com/registration/academic-license-reg).

You can run `nix-shell gurobi-shell.nix` to try it out, then run `gurobi.sh` and try [to solve an LP](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.0/quickstart_linux/reading_and_optimizing_a_m.html).
