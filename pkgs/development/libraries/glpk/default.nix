# however, it is much less efficient.

    # GLPK makes it possible to customize its message printing behaviour. Sage
    # does that and needs to differentiate between printing regular messages and
    # printing errors. Unfortunately there is no way to tell and glpk upstream
    # rejected this patch. All it does is set the variable pointing to the error
    # file back to NULL before glpk calls abort(). In sage's case, abort won't
    # actually be called because the error handler jumps out of the function.
    # This shouldn't affect everybody else, since glpk just calls abort()
    # immediately afterwards anyways.
    # See the sage trac ticket for more details:
