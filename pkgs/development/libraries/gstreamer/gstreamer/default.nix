    longDescription = ''
      GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling
      components.  The applications it supports range from simple
      Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio
      (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

      Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter
      technology transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and
      filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic
      interface.
