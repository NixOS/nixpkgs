      Intel Threading Building Blocks offers a rich and complete approach to
      expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library that helps you
      take advantage of multi-core processor performance without having to be a
      threading expert. Intel TBB is not just a threads-replacement library. It
      represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform
      details and threading mechanisms for scalability and performance.
