      The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of the simple syslog() API
      provided on UNIX systems. The major difference between EventLog and
      syslog is that EventLog tries to add structure to messages.

      Where you had a simple non-structrured string in syslog() you have a
      combination of description and tag/value pairs.
