    longDescription = ''
      GNU lightning is a library that generates assembly language code
      at run-time; it is very fast, making it ideal for Just-In-Time
      compilers, and it abstracts over the target CPU, as it exposes
      to the clients a standardized RISC instruction set inspired by
      the MIPS and SPARC chips.
