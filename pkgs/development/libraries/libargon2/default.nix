      A password-hashing function created by by Alex Biryukov, Daniel Dinu, and
      Dmitry Khovratovich. Argon2 was declared the winner of the Password
      Hashing Competition (PHC). There were 24 submissions and 9 finalists.
      Catena, Lyra2, Makwa and yescrypt were given special recognition. The PHC
      recommends using Argon2 rather than legacy algorithms.
