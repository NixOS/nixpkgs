    Hamlib provides a standardized programming interface that applications
    can use to send the appropriate commands to a radio.

    Also included in the package is a simple radio control program 'rigctl',
    which lets one control a radio transceiver or receiver, either from
    command line interface or in a text-oriented interactive interface.
