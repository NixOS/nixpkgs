      Hunspell is the spell checker of LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla
      Firefox 3 & Thunderbird, Google Chrome, and it is also used by
      proprietary software packages, like macOS, InDesign, memoQ, Opera and
      SDL Trados.

      Main features:

      * Extended support for language peculiarities; Unicode character encoding, compounding and complex morphology.
      * Improved suggestion using n-gram similarity, rule and dictionary based pronunciation data.
      * Morphological analysis, stemming and generation.
      * Hunspell is based on MySpell and works also with MySpell dictionaries.
      * C++ library under GPL/LGPL/MPL tri-license.
      * Interfaces and ports:
        * Enchant (Generic spelling library from the Abiword project),
        * XSpell (macOS port, but Hunspell is part of the macOS from version 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and
            now it is enough to place Hunspell dictionary files into
            ~/Library/Spelling or /Library/Spelling for spell checking),
        * Delphi, Java (JNA, JNI), Perl, .NET, Python, Ruby ([1], [2]), UNO.
