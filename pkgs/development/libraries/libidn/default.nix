    longDescription = ''
      GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the
      Stringprep, Punycode and IDNA specifications.  Libidn's purpose
      is to encode and decode internationalized domain names.  The
      native C, C\# and Java libraries are available under the GNU
      Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later.

      The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation.
      Profiles for Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are
      included.  Punycode and ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA
      are supported.  A mechanism to define Top-Level Domain (TLD)
      specific validation tables, and to compare strings against those
      tables, is included.  Default tables for some TLDs are also
      included.
