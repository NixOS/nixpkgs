+     compromise and attention to symmetry (A or AAAA queries can be
+     returned in any order).  What follows is a breakdown of how this
+     code is expected to work and why. We discuss only SUCCESS,
+     TRYAGAIN, NOTFOUND and UNAVAIL, since they are the only returns
+     that apply (though RETURN and MERGE exist).  We make a distinction
+     between TRYAGAIN (recoverable) and TRYAGAIN' (not-recoverable).
+     A recoverable TRYAGAIN is almost always due to buffer size issues
+     and returns ERANGE in errno and the caller is expected to retry
+     with a larger buffer.
+
+     Lastly, you may be tempted to make significant changes to the
+     conditions in this code to bring about symmetry between responses.
+     Please don't change anything without due consideration for
+     expected application behaviour.  Some of the synthesized responses
+     aren't very well thought out and sometimes appear to imply that
+     IPv4 responses are always answer 1, and IPv6 responses are always
+     answer 2, but that's not true (see the implemetnation of send_dg
+     and send_vc to see response can arrive in any order, particlarly
+     for UDP). However, we expect it holds roughly enough of the time
+     that this code works, but certainly needs to be fixed to make this
+     a more robust implementation.

+     [1] If the first response is a success we return success.
+         This ignores the state of the second answer and in fact
+         incorrectly sets errno and h_errno to that of the second
+	 answer.  However because the response is a success we ignore
+	 *errnop and *h_errnop (though that means you touched errno on
+         success).  We are being conservative here and returning the
+         likely IPv4 response in the first answer as a success.
+
+     [2] If the first response is a recoverable TRYAGAIN we return
+	 that instead of looking at the second response.  The
+	 expectation here is that we have failed to get an IPv4 response
+	 and should retry both queries.
+
+     [3] If the first response was not a SUCCESS and the second
+	 response is not NOTFOUND (had a SUCCESS, need to TRYAGAIN,
+	 or failed entirely e.g. TRYAGAIN' and UNAVAIL) then use the
+	 result from the second response, otherwise the first responses
+	 status is used.  Again we have some odd side-effects when the
+	 second response is NOTFOUND because we overwrite *errnop and
+	 *h_errnop that means that a first answer of NOTFOUND might see
+	 its *errnop and *h_errnop values altered.  Whether it matters
+	 in practice that a first response NOTFOUND has the wrong
+	 *errnop and *h_errnop is undecided.
+
+     [4] If the first response is UNAVAIL we return that instead of
+	 looking at the second response.  The expectation here is that
+	 it will have failed similarly e.g. configuration failure.
+
+     [5] Testing this code is complicated by the fact that truncated
+	 second response buffers might be returned as SUCCESS if the
+	 first answer is a SUCCESS.  To fix this we add symmetry to
+	 TRYAGAIN with the second response.  If the second response
+	 is a recoverable error we now return TRYAGIN even if the first
+	 response was SUCCESS.  */

+/* The send_vc function is responsible for sending a DNS query over TCP
+   to the nameserver numbered NS from the res_state STATP i.e.
+   EXT(statp).nssocks[ns].  The function supports sending both IPv4 and
+   IPv6 queries at the same serially on the same socket.
+
+   Please note that for TCP there is no way to disable sending both
+   queries, unlike UDP, which honours RES_SNGLKUP and RES_SNGLKUPREOP
+   and sends the queries serially and waits for the result after each
+   sent query.  This implemetnation should be corrected to honour these
+   options.
+
+   Please also note that for TCP we send both queries over the same
+   socket one after another.  This technically violates best practice
+   since the server is allowed to read the first query, respond, and
+   then close the socket (to service another client).  If the server
+   does this, then the remaining second query in the socket data buffer
+   will cause the server to send the client an RST which will arrive
+   asynchronously and the client's OS will likely tear down the socket
+   receive buffer resulting in a potentially short read and lost
+   response data.  This will force the client to retry the query again,
+   and this process may repeat until all servers and connection resets
+   are exhausted and then the query will fail.  It's not known if this
+   happens with any frequency in real DNS server implementations.  This
+   implementation should be corrected to use two sockets by default for
+   parallel queries.
+
+   The query stored in BUF of BUFLEN length is sent first followed by
+   the query stored in BUF2 of BUFLEN2 length.  Queries are sent
+   serially on the same socket.
+
+   Answers to the query are stored firstly in *ANSP up to a max of
+   *ANSSIZP bytes.  If more than *ANSSIZP bytes are needed and ANSCP
+   is non-NULL (to indicate that modifying the answer buffer is allowed)
+   then malloc is used to allocate a new response buffer and ANSCP and
+   ANSP will both point to the new buffer.  If more than *ANSSIZP bytes
+   are needed but ANSCP is NULL, then as much of the response as
+   possible is read into the buffer, but the results will be truncated.
+   When truncation happens because of a small answer buffer the DNS
+   packets header feild TC will bet set to 1, indicating a truncated
+   message and the rest of the socket data will be read and discarded.
+
+   Answers to the query are stored secondly in *ANSP2 up to a max of
+   *ANSSIZP2 bytes, with the actual response length stored in
+   *RESPLEN2.  If more than *ANSSIZP bytes are needed and ANSP2
+   is non-NULL (required for a second query) then malloc is used to
+   allocate a new response buffer, *ANSSIZP2 is set to the new buffer
+   size and *ANSP2_MALLOCED is set to 1.
+
+   The ANSP2_MALLOCED argument will eventually be removed as the
+   change in buffer pointer can be used to detect the buffer has
+   changed and that the caller should use free on the new buffer.
+
+   Note that the answers may arrive in any order from the server and
+   therefore the first and second answer buffers may not correspond to
+   the first and second queries.
+
+   It is not supported to call this function with a non-NULL ANSP2
+   but a NULL ANSCP.  Put another way, you can call send_vc with a
+   single unmodifiable buffer or two modifiable buffers, but no other
+   combination is supported.
+
+   It is the caller's responsibility to free the malloc allocated
+   buffers by detecting that the pointers have changed from their
+   original values i.e. *ANSCP or *ANSP2 has changed.
+
+   If errors are encountered then *TERRNO is set to an appropriate
+   errno value and a zero result is returned for a recoverable error,
+   and a less-than zero result is returned for a non-recoverable error.
+
+   If no errors are encountered then *TERRNO is left unmodified and
+   a the length of the first response in bytes is returned.  */
