    longDescription =
      '' GNU dbm (or GDBM, for short) is a library of database functions that
         use extensible hashing and work similar to the standard UNIX dbm.
         These routines are provided to a programmer needing to create and
         manipulate a hashed database.

         The basic use of GDBM is to store key/data pairs in a data file.
         Each key must be unique and each key is paired with only one data
         item.

         The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs,
         searching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key
         along with its data.  It also support sequential iteration over all
         key/data pairs in a database.

         For compatibility with programs using old UNIX dbm function, the
         package also provides traditional dbm and ndbm interfaces.
