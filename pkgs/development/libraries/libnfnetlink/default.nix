    longDescription = ''
      libnfnetlink is the low-level library for netfilter related kernel/userspace communication.
      It provides a generic messaging infrastructure for in-kernel netfilter subsystems
      (such as nfnetlink_log, nfnetlink_queue, nfnetlink_conntrack) and their respective users
      and/or management tools in userspace.

      This library is not meant as a public API for application developers.
      It is only used by other netfilter.org projects, like the aforementioned ones.
