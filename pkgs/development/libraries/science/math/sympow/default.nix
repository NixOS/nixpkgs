  # Usually, sympow has 3 levels of caching: statically distributed in /usr/,

  # other users and a shared /var is not compatible with nix's approach, so we
  # set VARPREFIX to the read-only $out. This effectively disables shared
  # caching. See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3360#comment:36 and sympow's
  # README for more details on caching.
  # sympow will complain at runtime about the lack of write-permissions on the
  # shared cache. We pass the `-quiet` flag by default to disable this.
