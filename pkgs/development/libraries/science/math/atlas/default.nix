# Atlas detects the CPU and optimizes its build accordingly. This is great when
# the code is run on the same machine that built the binary, but in case of a
# central build farm like Hydra, this feature is dangerous because the code may
# be generated utilizing fancy features that users who download the binary
# cannot execute.
#
# To avoid these issues, the build is configured using the 'cpuConfig'
# parameter. Upstream recommends these defaults for distributions:
#
#   | x86 CPU                                     | x86_64 CPU             |
#   |---------------------------------------------+------------------------|
#   | -b 32                                       | -b 64                  |
#   | -A 12  (x86x87)                             | -A 14 (x86SSE2)        |
#   | -V 1 (No SIMD)                              | -V 384 (SSE1 and SSE2) |
#
# These defaults should give consistent performance across machines.
# Performance will be substantially lower than an optimized build, but a build
# optimized for one machine will give even worse performance on others. If you
# are a serious user of Atlas (e.g., you write code that uses it) you should
# compile an optimized version for each of your machines.
#
# The parameter 'cacheEdge' sets the L2 cache per core (in bytes). Setting this
# parameter reduces build time because some tests to detect the L2 cache size
# will not be run. It will also reduce impurity; different build nodes on Hydra
# may have different L2 cache sizes, but fixing the L2 cache size should
# account for that. This also makes the performance of binary substitutes more
# consistent.
#
# The -V flags can change with each release as new instruction sets are added
# because upstream thinks it's a good idea to add entries at the start of an
# enum, rather than the end. If the build suddenly fails with messages about
# missing instruction sets, you may need to poke around in the source a bit.
#
# Upstream recommends the x86x87/x86SSE2 architectures for generic x86/x86_64
# for distribution builds. Additionally, we set 'cacheEdge' to reduce impurity.
# Otherwise, the cache parameters will be detected by timing which will be
# highly variable on Hydra.
