          getdns is an implementation of a modern asynchronous DNS API; the
          specification was originally edited by Paul Hoffman. It is intended to make all
          types of DNS information easily available to application developers and non-DNS
          experts. DNSSEC offers a unique global infrastructure for establishing and
          enhancing cryptographic trust relations. With the development of this API the
          developers intend to offer application developers a modern and flexible
          interface that enables end-to-end trust in the DNS architecture, and which will
          inspire application developers to implement innovative security solutions in
          their applications.

          Stubby is an application that acts as a local DNS Privacy stub
          resolver (using RFC 7858, aka DNS-over-TLS). Stubby encrypts DNS
          queries sent from a client machine (desktop or laptop) to a DNS
          Privacy resolver increasing end user privacy. Stubby is developed by
          the getdns team.
