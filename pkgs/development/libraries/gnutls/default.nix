    longDescription = ''
       GnuTLS is a project that aims to develop a library which
       provides a secure layer, over a reliable transport
       layer. Currently the GnuTLS library implements the proposed
       standards by the IETF's TLS working group.

       Quoting from the TLS protocol specification:

       "The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the
       Internet. The protocol allows client/server applications to
       communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
       tampering, or message forgery."
