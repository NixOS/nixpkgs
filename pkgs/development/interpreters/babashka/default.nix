    longDescription = ''
      The main idea behind babashka is to leverage Clojure in places where you
      would be using bash otherwise.

      As one user described it:

          I’m quite at home in Bash most of the time, but there’s a substantial
          grey area of things that are too complicated to be simple in bash, but
          too simple to be worth writing a clj/s script for. Babashka really
          seems to hit the sweet spot for those cases.

      Goals:

      - Low latency Clojure scripting alternative to JVM Clojure.
      - Easy installation: grab the self-contained binary and run. No JVM needed.
      - Familiarity and portability:
        - Scripts should be compatible with JVM Clojure as much as possible
        - Scripts should be platform-independent as much as possible. Babashka
          offers support for linux, macOS and Windows.
      - Allow interop with commonly used classes like java.io.File and System
      - Multi-threading support (pmap, future, core.async)
      - Batteries included (tools.cli, cheshire, ...)
      - Library support via popular tools like the clojure CLI
