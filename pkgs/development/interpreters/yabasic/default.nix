      Yabasic is a traditional basic-interpreter. It comes with goto and various
      loops and allows to define subroutines and libraries. It does simple
      graphics and printing. Yabasic can call out to libraries written in C and
      allows to create standalone programs. Yabasic runs under Unix and Windows
      and has a comprehensive documentation; it is small, simple, open-source
      and free.
