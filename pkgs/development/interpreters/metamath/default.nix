      The metamath program is an ASCII-based ANSI C program with a command-line
      interface. It was used (along with mmj2) to build and verify the proofs
      in the Metamath Proof Explorer, and it generated its web pages. The *.mm
      ASCII databases (set.mm and others) are also included in this derivation.
