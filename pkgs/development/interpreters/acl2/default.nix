      ACL2 is a logic and programming language in which you can model
      computer systems, together with a tool to help you prove
      properties of those models. "ACL2" denotes "A Computational
      Logic for Applicative Common Lisp".

      ACL2 is part of the Boyer-Moore family of provers, for which its
      authors have received the 2005 ACM Software System Award.

      NOTE: In nixpkgs, the community books that usually ship with
      ACL2 have been removed because it is not currently possible to
      build them with Nix.
