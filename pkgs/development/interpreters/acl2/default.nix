      ACL2 is a logic and programming language in which you can model computer
      systems, together with a tool to help you prove properties of those
      models. "ACL2" denotes "A Computational Logic for Applicative Common
      Lisp".

      ACL2 is part of the Boyer-Moore family of provers, for which its authors
      have received the 2005 ACM Software System Award.

      This package installs the main ACL2 executable ${pname}, as well as the
      build tools cert.pl and clean.pl, renamed to ${pname}-cert and
      ${pname}-clean.
