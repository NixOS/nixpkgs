  # This patch does the following:
  # 1) Do use the PATH environment variable to find the `pwd' command.
  #    By default, Perl will only look for it in /lib and /usr/lib.
  #    !!! what are the security implications of this?
  # 2) Force the use of <errno.h>, not /usr/include/errno.h, on Linux
  #    systems.  (This actually appears to be due to a bug in Perl.)
