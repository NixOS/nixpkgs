    description = "A Clojure babushka for the grey areas of Bash";
    longDescription = ''
      The main idea behind babashka is to leverage Clojure in places where you
      would be using bash otherwise.

      As one user described it:

          I’m quite at home in Bash most of the time, but there’s a substantial
          grey area of things that are too complicated to be simple in bash, but
          too simple to be worth writing a clj/s script for. Babashka really
          seems to hit the sweet spot for those cases.

    Goals:

    - Low latency Clojure scripting alternative to JVM Clojure.
    - Easy installation: grab the self-contained binary and run. No JVM needed.
    - Familiarity and portability:
      - Scripts should be compatible with JVM Clojure as much as possible
      - Scripts should be platform-independent as much as possible. Babashka
        offers support for linux, macOS and Windows.
    - Allow interop with commonly used classes like java.io.File and System
    - Multi-threading support (pmap, future, core.async)
    - Batteries included (tools.cli, cheshire, ...)
    - Library support via popular tools like the clojure CLI
