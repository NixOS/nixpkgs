      GNU Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, with
      support for many SRFIs, packaged for use in a wide variety of
      environments.  In addition to implementing the R5RS Scheme standard
      and a large subset of R6RS, Guile includes a module system, full access
      to POSIX system calls, networking support, multiple threads, dynamic
      linking, a foreign function call interface, and powerful string
      processing.
