      Racket is a full-spectrum programming language. It goes beyond
      Lisp and Scheme with dialects that support objects, types,
      laziness, and more. Racket enables programmers to link
      components written in different dialects, and it empowers
      programmers to create new, project-specific dialects. Racket's
      libraries support applications from web servers and databases to
      GUIs and charts.

      This minimal distribution includes just enough of Racket that you can
      use `raco pkg` to install more.
