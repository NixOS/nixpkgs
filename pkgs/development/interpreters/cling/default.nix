# *NOT* from LLVM 9!
# The compiler used to compile Cling may affect the runtime include and lib
# directories it expects to be run with. Cling builds against (a fork of) Clang,
# so we prefer to use Clang as the compiler as well for consistency.
# It would be cleanest to use LLVM 9's clang, but it errors. So, we use a later
# version of Clang to compile, but we check out the Cling fork of Clang 9 to
# build Cling against.
