  # The flags passed to the wrapped cling should

  # b) provide it with the include files and libs it needs (C and C++ standard library)

  # These are also exposed as cling.flags/cling.compilerIncludeFlags because it's handy to be
  # able to pass them to tools that wrap Cling, particularly Jupyter kernels such as xeus-cling
  # and the built-in jupyter-cling-kernel. Both of these use Cling as a library by linking against
  # libclingJupyter.so, so the makeWrapper approach to wrapping the binary doesn't work.
  # Thus, if you're packaging a Jupyter kernel, you either need to pass these flags as extra
  # args to xcpp (for xeus-cling) or put them in the environment variable CLING_OPTS
  # (for jupyter-cling-kernel)
