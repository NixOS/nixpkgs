zentest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing
code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker pace.
zentest only works with Ruby and Minitest or Test::Unit. There is
enough evidence to show that this is still proving useful to users, so
it stays.

unit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from
actual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.
Do note that minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating
the need for unit_diff

autotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during
development. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the
corresponding dependent tests.

multiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great
for compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your
installed versions.'';

== SYNOPSIS:

	Antwrap is a Ruby library that can be used to invoke Ant tasks. It is being used in the Buildr (http://incubator.apache.org/buildr/) project to execute 
	Ant (http://ant.apache.org/) tasks in a Java project. If you are tired of fighting with Ant or Maven XML files in your Java project, take some time to

        longDescription = ''This library allows for the identification of a file's likely MIME content
type. This is release 1.25, adding experimental caching and lazy loading
functionality.

The caching and lazy loading features were initially implemented by Greg
Brockman (gdb). As these features are experimental, they are disabled by
default and must be enabled through the use of environment variables. The cache
is invalidated on a per-version basis; the cache for version 1.25 will not be
reused for version 1.26.

To use lazy loading, set the environment variable +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD+
to any value other than 'false'. When using lazy loading, the initial startup
of MIME::Types is around 12–25× faster than normal startup (on my system,
normal startup is about 90 ms; lazy startup is about 4 ms). This isn't
generally useful, however, as the MIME::Types database has not been loaded.
Lazy startup and load is just *slightly* faster—around 1 ms. The real advantage
comes from using the cache.

To enable the cache, set the environment variable +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_CACHE+ to a
filename where MIME::Types will have read-write access. The first time a new
version of MIME::Types is run using this file, it will be created, taking a
little longer than normal. Subsequent loads using the same cache file will be
approximately 3½× faster (25 ms) than normal loads. This can be combined with
+RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD+, but this is *not* recommended in a multithreaded
or multiprocess environment where all threads or processes will be using the
same cache file.

As the caching interface is still experimental, the only values cached are the
default MIME::Types database, not any custom MIME::Types added by users.

MIME types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or HTTP
traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. MIME::Types
provides the ability for detailed information about MIME entities (provided as
a set of MIME::Type objects) to be determined and used programmatically. There
are many types defined by RFCs and vendors, so the list is long but not
complete; don't hesitate to ask to add additional information. This library
follows the IANA collection of MIME types (see below for reference).

MIME::Types for Ruby was originally based on MIME::Types for Perl by Mark
Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. As of version 1.15, the data format for the
MIME::Type list has changed and the synchronization will no longer happen.

MIME::Types is built to conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It
tracks the {IANA registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/]
({ftp}[ftp://ftp.iana.org/assignments/media-types]) with some unofficial types
added from the {LTSW collection}[http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/mime.htp]

add additional type definitions (see Contributing.rdoc). The primary sources
for MIME type definitions found in mime-types is the IANA collection of
registrations (see below for the link), RFCs, and W3C recommendations.

The mime-types library uses semantic versioning. This is release 2.0; there are
incompatible changes in the API provided by mime-types, mostly around registry
initialization (see History.rdoc for full details), and the removal of support
for Ruby 1.8 interpreters.

     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test

     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable

minitest/unit is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.

minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/unit and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.

minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!

minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.

minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

minitest/unit is meant to have a clean implementation for language
implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
discovery.

    "Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!"

The RightScale AWS gems have been designed to provide a robust, fast, and secure interface to Amazon EC2, EBS, S3, SQS, SDB, and CloudFront.
These gems have been used in production by RightScale since late 2006 and are being maintained to track enhancements made by Amazon.
The RightScale AWS gems comprise:

- RightAws::Ec2 -- interface to Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and the
  associated EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- RightAws::S3 and RightAws::S3Interface -- interface to Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- RightAws::Sqs and RightAws::SqsInterface -- interface to first-generation Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) (API version 2007-05-01)
- RightAws::SqsGen2 and RightAws::SqsGen2Interface -- interface to second-generation Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) (API version 2008-01-01)
- RightAws::SdbInterface and RightAws::ActiveSdb -- interface to Amazon SDB (SimpleDB)
- RightAws::AcfInterface -- interface to Amazon CloudFront, a content distribution service

== FEATURES:

- Full programmmatic access to EC2, EBS, S3, SQS, SDB, and CloudFront.
- Complete error handling: all operations check for errors and report complete
  error information by raising an AwsError.
- Persistent HTTP connections with robust network-level retry layer using
  RightHttpConnection).  This includes socket timeouts and retries.
- Robust HTTP-level retry layer.  Certain (user-adjustable) HTTP errors returned
  by Amazon's services are classified as temporary errors.
  These errors are automaticallly retried using exponentially increasing intervals.
  The number of retries is user-configurable.
- Fast REXML-based parsing of responses (as fast as a pure Ruby solution allows).
- Uses libxml (if available) for faster response parsing.
- Support for large S3 list operations.  Buckets and key subfolders containing
  many (&gt; 1000) keys are listed in entirety.  Operations based on list (like
  bucket clear) work on arbitrary numbers of keys.
- Support for streaming GETs from S3, and streaming PUTs to S3 if the data source is a file.
- Support for single-threaded usage, multithreaded usage, as well as usage with multiple
  AWS accounts.
- Support for both first- and second-generation SQS (API versions 2007-05-01
  and 2008-01-01).  These versions of SQS are not compatible.
- Support for signature versions 0 and 1 on SQS, SDB, and EC2.
- Interoperability with any cloud running Eucalyptus (http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu)
- Test suite (requires AWS account to do "live" testing).
