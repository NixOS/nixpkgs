zentest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing
code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker pace.
zentest only works with Ruby and Minitest or Test::Unit. There is
enough evidence to show that this is still proving useful to users, so
it stays.

unit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from
actual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.
Do note that minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating
the need for unit_diff

autotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during
development. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the
corresponding dependent tests.

multiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great
for compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your
installed versions.'';

== SYNOPSIS:

	Antwrap is a Ruby library that can be used to invoke Ant tasks. It is being used in the Buildr (http://incubator.apache.org/buildr/) project to execute 
	Ant (http://ant.apache.org/) tasks in a Java project. If you are tired of fighting with Ant or Maven XML files in your Java project, take some time to

    It supports reading and writing all PNG variants that are defined in the specification, 
    with one limitation: only 8-bit color depth is supported. It supports all transparency, 
    interlacing and filtering options the PNG specifications allows. It can also read and 
    write textual metadata from PNG files. Low-level read/write access to PNG chunks is
    also possible.
    
    This library supports simple drawing on the image canvas and simple operations like
    alpha composition and cropping. Finally, it can import from and export to RMagick for 
    interoperability.
    
    Also, have a look at OilyPNG at http://github.com/wvanbergen/oily_png. OilyPNG is a 
    drop in mixin module that implements some of the ChunkyPNG algorithms in C, which 
    provides a massive speed boost to encoding and decoding.

        longDescription = ''The mime-types library provides a library and registry for information about
MIME content type definitions. It can be used to determine defined filename
extensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely
MIME type definitions.

MIME content types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or
HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. The
mime-types library provides the ability for detailed information about MIME
entities (provided as an enumerable collection of MIME::Type objects) to be
determined and used programmatically. There are many types defined by RFCs and
vendors, so the list is long but by definition incomplete; don't hesitate to to
add additional type definitions (see Contributing.rdoc). The primary sources
for MIME type definitions found in mime-types is the IANA collection of
registrations (see below for the link), RFCs, and W3C recommendations.

This is release 2.2, mostly changing how the MIME type registry is updated from
the IANA registry (the format of which was incompatibly changed shortly before
this release) and taking advantage of the extra data available from IANA
registry in the form of MIME::Type#xrefs. In addition, the {LTSW
list}[http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/mime.htp] has been dropped as a
supported list.

As a reminder, mime-types 2.x is no longer compatible with Ruby 1.8 and
mime-types 1.x is only being maintained for security issues. No new MIME types
or features will be added.

mime-types (previously called MIME::Types for Ruby) was originally based on
MIME::Types for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. It is built to
conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It tracks the {IANA Media
Types registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml]
with some types added by the users of mime-types.'';

    "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were

     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
     frameworks...

     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable

     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity."

    -- Wayne E. Seguin

minitest/unit is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.

minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/unit and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.

minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!

minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.

minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

minitest/unit is meant to have a clean implementation for language
implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
discovery.

    "Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!"

    -- Piotr Szotkowski

Comparing to rspec:

    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

  file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
  tasks for building tarballs and publishing to FTP or SSH sites.  (Formerly
  tasks for building RDoc and Gems were included in rake but they're now
  available in RDoc and RubyGems respectively.)

The RightScale AWS gems have been designed to provide a robust, fast, and secure interface to Amazon EC2, EBS, S3, SQS, SDB, and CloudFront.
These gems have been used in production by RightScale since late 2006 and are being maintained to track enhancements made by Amazon.
The RightScale AWS gems comprise:

- RightAws::Ec2 -- interface to Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and the
  associated EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- RightAws::S3 and RightAws::S3Interface -- interface to Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- RightAws::Sqs and RightAws::SqsInterface -- interface to first-generation Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) (API version 2007-05-01)
- RightAws::SqsGen2 and RightAws::SqsGen2Interface -- interface to second-generation Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) (API version 2008-01-01)
- RightAws::SdbInterface and RightAws::ActiveSdb -- interface to Amazon SDB (SimpleDB)
- RightAws::AcfInterface -- interface to Amazon CloudFront, a content distribution service

== FEATURES:

- Full programmmatic access to EC2, EBS, S3, SQS, SDB, and CloudFront.
- Complete error handling: all operations check for errors and report complete
  error information by raising an AwsError.
- Persistent HTTP connections with robust network-level retry layer using
  RightHttpConnection).  This includes socket timeouts and retries.
- Robust HTTP-level retry layer.  Certain (user-adjustable) HTTP errors returned
  by Amazon's services are classified as temporary errors.
  These errors are automaticallly retried using exponentially increasing intervals.
  The number of retries is user-configurable.
- Fast REXML-based parsing of responses (as fast as a pure Ruby solution allows).
- Uses libxml (if available) for faster response parsing.
- Support for large S3 list operations.  Buckets and key subfolders containing
  many (&gt; 1000) keys are listed in entirety.  Operations based on list (like
  bucket clear) work on arbitrary numbers of keys.
- Support for streaming GETs from S3, and streaming PUTs to S3 if the data source is a file.
- Support for single-threaded usage, multithreaded usage, as well as usage with multiple
  AWS accounts.
- Support for both first- and second-generation SQS (API versions 2007-05-01
  and 2008-01-01).  These versions of SQS are not compatible.
- Support for signature versions 0 and 1 on SQS, SDB, and EC2.
- Interoperability with any cloud running Eucalyptus (http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu)
- Test suite (requires AWS account to do "live" testing).
