zentest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing
code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker pace.
zentest only works with Ruby and Minitest or Test::Unit. There is
enough evidence to show that this is still proving useful to users, so
it stays.

unit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from
actual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.
Do note that minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating
the need for unit_diff

autotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during
development. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the
corresponding dependent tests.

multiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great
for compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your
installed versions.'';

== SYNOPSIS:

	Antwrap is a Ruby library that can be used to invoke Ant tasks. It is being used in the Buildr (http://incubator.apache.org/buildr/) project to execute

{Algorithm::Diff 1.15}[http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15/].

This is release 1.1.3, fixing several small bugs found over the years. Version
1.1.0 added new features, including the ability to #patch and #unpatch changes
as well as a new contextual diff callback, Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallbacks,
that should improve the context sensitivity of patching.

This library is called Diff::LCS because of an early version of Algorithm::Diff
which was restrictively licensed. This version has seen a minor license change:
instead of being under Ruby's license as an option, the third optional license
is the MIT license.'';

MIME types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or
HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted.
MIME::Types provides the ability for detailed information about MIME
entities (provided as a set of MIME::Type objects) to be determined and
used programmatically. There are many types defined by RFCs and vendors,
so the list is long but not complete; don't hesitate to ask to add
additional information. This library follows the IANA collection of MIME
types (see below for reference).

MIME::Types for Ruby was originally based on and synchronized with MIME::Types
for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. As of version 1.15, the data
format for the MIME::Type list has changed and the synchronization will no
longer happen.

MIME::Types is built to conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It
follows the official {IANA registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/]
({ftp}[ftp://ftp.iana.org/assignments/media-types]) with some unofficial types

The RightScale AWS gems have been designed to provide a robust, fast, and secure interface to Amazon EC2, EBS, S3, SQS, SDB, and CloudFront.
These gems have been used in production by RightScale since late 2006 and are being maintained to track enhancements made by Amazon.
The RightScale AWS gems comprise:

- RightAws::Ec2 -- interface to Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and the
  associated EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- RightAws::S3 and RightAws::S3Interface -- interface to Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- RightAws::Sqs and RightAws::SqsInterface -- interface to first-generation Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) (API version 2007-05-01)
- RightAws::SqsGen2 and RightAws::SqsGen2Interface -- interface to second-generation Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) (API version 2008-01-01)
- RightAws::SdbInterface and RightAws::ActiveSdb -- interface to Amazon SDB (SimpleDB)
- RightAws::AcfInterface -- interface to Amazon CloudFront, a content distribution service

== FEATURES:

- Full programmmatic access to EC2, EBS, S3, SQS, SDB, and CloudFront.
- Complete error handling: all operations check for errors and report complete
  error information by raising an AwsError.
- Persistent HTTP connections with robust network-level retry layer using
  RightHttpConnection).  This includes socket timeouts and retries.
- Robust HTTP-level retry layer.  Certain (user-adjustable) HTTP errors returned
  by Amazon's services are classified as temporary errors.
  These errors are automaticallly retried using exponentially increasing intervals.
  The number of retries is user-configurable.
- Fast REXML-based parsing of responses (as fast as a pure Ruby solution allows).
- Uses libxml (if available) for faster response parsing.
- Support for large S3 list operations.  Buckets and key subfolders containing
  many (&gt; 1000) keys are listed in entirety.  Operations based on list (like
  bucket clear) work on arbitrary numbers of keys.
- Support for streaming GETs from S3, and streaming PUTs to S3 if the data source is a file.
- Support for single-threaded usage, multithreaded usage, as well as usage with multiple
  AWS accounts.
- Support for both first- and second-generation SQS (API versions 2007-05-01
  and 2008-01-01).  These versions of SQS are not compatible.
- Support for signature versions 0 and 1 on SQS, SDB, and EC2.
- Interoperability with any cloud running Eucalyptus (http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu)
- Test suite (requires AWS account to do "live" testing).
