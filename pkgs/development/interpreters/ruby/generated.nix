zentest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing

zentest only works with Ruby and Minitest or Test::Unit. There is
enough evidence to show that this is still proving useful to users, so
it stays.

unit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from
actual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.
Do note that minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating
the need for unit_diff

autotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during
development. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the
corresponding dependent tests.

multiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great
for compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your
installed versions.'';

type. This is release 1.21 with new MIME types. The identification of MIME
content type is based on a file's filename extensions.

MIME types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or
HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted.
MIME::Types provides the ability for detailed information about MIME
entities (provided as a set of MIME::Type objects) to be determined and
used programmatically. There are many types defined by RFCs and vendors,
so the list is long but not complete; don't hesitate to ask to add
additional information. This library follows the IANA collection of MIME
types (see below for reference).

MIME::Types for Ruby was originally based on and synchronized with MIME::Types
for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. As of version 1.15, the data
format for the MIME::Type list has changed and the synchronization will no
longer happen.

MIME::Types is built to conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It
follows the official {IANA registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/]
({ftp}[ftp://ftp.iana.org/assignments/media-types]) with some unofficial types
added from the the {LTSW collection}[http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/mime.htp].'';
