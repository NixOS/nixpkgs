      Nickel is the cheap configuration language.

      Its purpose is to automate the generation of static configuration files -
      think JSON, YAML, XML, or your favorite data representation language -
      that are then fed to another system. It is designed to have a simple,
      well-understood core: it is in essence JSON with functions.
