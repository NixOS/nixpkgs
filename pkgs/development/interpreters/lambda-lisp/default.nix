    longDescription = ''
      LambdaLisp is a Lisp interpreter written as a closed untyped lambda calculus term.
      It is written as a lambda calculus term LambdaLisp = Î»x. ... which takes a string
      x as an input and returns a string as an output. The input x is the Lisp program
      and the user's standard input, and the output is the standard output. Characters
      are encoded into lambda term representations of natural numbers using the Church
      encoding, and strings are encoded as a list of characters with lists expressed as
      lambdas in the Mogensen-Scott encoding, so the entire computation process solely
      consists of the beta-reduction of lambda terms, without introducing any
      non-lambda-type object.
