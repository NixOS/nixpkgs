      Guile-Cairo wraps the Cairo graphics library for Guile Scheme.

      Guile-Cairo is complete, wrapping almost all of the Cairo API.  It is API
      stable, providing a firm base on which to do graphics work.  Finally, and
      importantly, it is pleasant to use.  You get a powerful and well
      maintained graphics library with all of the benefits of Scheme: memory
      management, exceptions, macros, and a dynamic programming environment.
