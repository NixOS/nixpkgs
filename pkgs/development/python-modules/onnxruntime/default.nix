# onnxruntime requires an older protobuf.
# Doing an override in protobuf in the python-packages set
# can give you a functioning Python package but note not
# all Python packages will be compatible then.
#
# Because protobuf is not always needed we remove it
# as a runtime dependency from our wheel.
#
# We do include here the non-Python protobuf so the shared libs
# link correctly. If you do also want to include the Python
# protobuf, you can add it to your Python env, but be aware
# the version likely mismatches with what is used here.
