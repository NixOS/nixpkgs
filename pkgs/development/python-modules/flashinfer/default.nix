  # FlashInfer offers two installation modes:
  #
  # JIT mode: CUDA kernels are compiled at runtime using PyTorch’s JIT, with
  # compiled kernels cached for future use. JIT mode allows fast installation,
  # as no CUDA kernels are pre-compiled, making it ideal for development and
  # testing. JIT version is also available as a sdist in PyPI.
  #
  # AOT mode: Core CUDA kernels are pre-compiled and included in the library,
  # reducing runtime compilation overhead. If a required kernel is not
  # pre-compiled, it will be compiled at runtime using JIT. AOT mode is
  # recommended for production environments.
  #
  # Here we use opt for the AOT version.

      FlashInfer is a library and kernel generator for Large Language Models
      that provides high-performance implementation of LLM GPU kernels such as
      FlashAttention, PageAttention and LoRA. FlashInfer focus on LLM serving
      and inference, and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse
      scenarios.
