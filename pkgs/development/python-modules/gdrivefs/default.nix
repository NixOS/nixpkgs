      GDriveFS is a FUSE wrapper for Google Drive developed. Design goals:
      - Thread for monitoring changes via "changes" functionality of API.
      - Complete stat() implementation.
      - Seamlessly work around duplicate-file allowances in Google Drive.
      - Seamlessly manage file-type versatility in Google Drive
        (Google Doc files do not have a particular format).
      - Allow for the same file at multiple paths.
