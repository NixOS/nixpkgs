      Boltons is a set of over 200 BSD-licensed, pure-Python utilities
      in the same spirit as - and yet conspicuously missing from - the
      standard library, including:

      - Atomic file saving, bolted on with fileutils
      - A highly-optimized OrderedMultiDict, in dictutils
      - Two types of PriorityQueue, in queueutils
      - Chunked and windowed iteration, in iterutils
      - Recursive data structure iteration and merging, with iterutils.remap
      - Exponential backoff functionality, including jitter, through
      iterutils.backoff
      - A full-featured TracebackInfo type, for representing stack
      traces, in tbutils
