      This Python package contains a set of basic tools that can help to create
      a Markdown file while running a Python code. Thus, if you are executing a
      Python code and you save the result in a text file, Why not format it? So
      using files such as Markdown can give a great look to those results. In
      this way, mdutils will make things easy for creating Markdown files.
