        PyERFA is the Python wrapper for the ERFA library (Essential Routines
        for Fundamental Astronomy), a C library containing key algorithms for
        astronomy, which is based on the SOFA library published by the
        International Astronomical Union (IAU). All C routines are wrapped as
        Numpy universal functions, so that they can be called with scalar or
        array inputs.
