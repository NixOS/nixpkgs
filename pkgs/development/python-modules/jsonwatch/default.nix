      jsonwatch is a command line utility with which you can track
      changes in JSON data delivered by a shell command or a web
      (HTTP/HTTPS) API.  jsonwatch requests data from the designated
      source repeatedly at a set interval and displays the
      differences when the data changes. It is similar in its
      behavior to how watch(1) with the -d switch works for
      plain-text data.
