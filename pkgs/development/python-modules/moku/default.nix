  Note: If you run `moku download` and encounter the error:

  Then use the $MOKU_DATA_PATH environment variable to control where the
  downloaded files will go to. It is undocumented upstream and there's no
  repository to contribute such documentation unfortunately. Also there is no
  suitable default value for this on Nix systems, so there's no patch we can
  apply locally to make the situation better.
