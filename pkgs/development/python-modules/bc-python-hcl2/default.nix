      This parser only supports HCL2 and isn't backwards compatible with HCL v1.
      It can be used to parse any HCL2 config file such as Terraform.

      This is a fork of the Python HCL2 repo by Amplify and is officially supported by Bridgecrew.
      The two projects are now deviating in a way that pushing new changes upstream doesn't make sense anymore.
