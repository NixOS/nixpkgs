      The dbt tool needs adapters to data sources in order to work. The available
      adapters are:

        dbt-bigquery
        dbt-postgres
        dbt-redshift
        dbt-snowflake

      An example of building this package with a few adapters:

        dbt.withAdapters (adapters: [
          adapters.dbt-bigquery
          adapters.dbt-postgres
        ])
