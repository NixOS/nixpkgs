      Python libpcap module is a low-level binding for libpcap C library.

      It is an effort to allow python programs full access to the API provided by the well known libpcap Unix C library and by its implementations provided under Win32 systems by such packet capture systems as: Npcap, WinPcap

      libpcap is a lightweight Python package, based on the ctypes library.

      It is fully compliant implementation of the original C libpcap from 1.0.0 up to 1.9.0 API and the WinPcapâ€™s 4.1.3 libpcap (1.0.0rel0b) API by implementing whole its functionality in a clean Python instead of C.
