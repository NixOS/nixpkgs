      Construct isolines/isosurfaces of a 2D/3D scalar field defined by a
      function, i.e. curves over which f(x,y)=0 or surfaces over which
      f(x,y,z)=0. Most similar libraries use marching squares or similar over a
      uniform grid, but this uses a quadtree to avoid wasting time sampling
      many far from the implicit surface.
