    longDescription = ''
      A "hook" file extends PyInstaller to adapt it to the special needs and methods used by a Python package.
      The word "hook" is used for two kinds of files. A runtime hook helps the bootloader to launch an app,
      setting up the environment. A package hook (there are several types of those) tells PyInstaller
      what to include in the final app - such as the data files and (hidden) imports mentioned above.
      This repository is a collection of hooks for many packages, and allows PyInstaller to work with these packages seamlessly.
