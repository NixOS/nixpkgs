      Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage, your Elasticsearch
      indices and snapshots by:

      * Obtaining the full list of indices (or snapshots) from the cluster, as the
        actionable list

      * Iterate through a list of user-defined filters to progressively remove
        indices (or snapshots) from this actionable list as needed.

      * Perform various actions on the items which remain in the actionable list.
