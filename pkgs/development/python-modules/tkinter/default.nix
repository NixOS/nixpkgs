      The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to
      the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix
      platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.

      Running python -m tkinter from the command line should open a window
      demonstrating a simple Tk interface, letting you know that tkinter is
      properly installed on your system, and also showing what version of
      Tcl/Tk is installed, so you can read the Tcl/Tk documentation specific to
      that version.

      Tkinter supports a range of Tcl/Tk versions, built either with or without
      thread support. The official Python binary release bundles Tcl/Tk 8.6
      threaded. See the source code for the _tkinter module for more
      information about supported versions.

      Tkinter is not a thin wrapper, but adds a fair amount of its own logic to
      make the experience more pythonic. This documentation will concentrate on
      these additions and changes, and refer to the official Tcl/Tk
      documentation for details that are unchanged.
