      Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis tool for finding bugs and
      enforcing code standards at editor, commit, and CI time. Semgrep analyzes
      code locally on your computer or in your build environment: code is never
      uploaded. Its rules look like the code you already write; no abstract
      syntax trees, regex wrestling, or painful DSLs.
