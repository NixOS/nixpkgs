  # This may be papering over a real failure where the env var activation route
  # for faulthandler does not appear to work. That said, since all other tests
  # pass and since this module is python 2 only (it was upstreamed into the
  # interpreter itself as of python 3.3 and is disabled ) this just disables the
  # test to fix the build. From inspecting Hydra logs and git bisect, the commit
  # that broke it is this one:
  # https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/90be4c2c7875c9487508d95b5c638d97e2903ada
