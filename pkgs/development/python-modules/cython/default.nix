    longDescription = ''
      Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming
      language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It
      makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.

      Cython gives you the combined power of Python and C to let you:

      - write Python code that calls back and forth from and to C or C++ code
        natively at any point.
      - easily tune readable Python code into plain C performance by adding
        static type declarations, also in Python syntax.
      - use combined source code level debugging to find bugs in your Python,
        Cython and C code.
      - interact efficiently with large data sets, e.g. using multi-dimensional
        NumPy arrays.
      - quickly build your applications within the large, mature and widely used
        CPython ecosystem.
      - integrate natively with existing code and data from legacy, low-level or
        high-performance libraries and applications.

      The Cython language is a superset of the Python language that additionally
      supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class
      attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code
      from Cython code.
