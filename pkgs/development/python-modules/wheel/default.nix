      This library is the reference implementation of the Python wheel packaging standard,
      as defined in PEP 427.

      It has two different roles:

      - A setuptools extension for building wheels that provides the bdist_wheel setuptools command
      - A command line tool for working with wheel files

      It should be noted that wheel is not intended to be used as a library,
      and as such there is no stable, public API.
