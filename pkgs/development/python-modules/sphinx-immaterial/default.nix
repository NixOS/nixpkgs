      This theme is regularly maintained to stay up to date with the upstream mkdocs-material repository.
      The HTML templates, JavaScript, and styles from the mkdocs-material theme are incorporated directly
      with mostly minor modifications.

      Independent of the upstream mkdocs-material theme, this theme integrates with and significantly
      extends Sphinxâ€™s API documentation functionality.

      This theme is a fork of the sphinx-material theme, which proved the concept of a Sphinx theme based
      on an earlier version of the mkdocs-material theme, but has now significantly diverged from the
      upstream mkdocs-material repository.
