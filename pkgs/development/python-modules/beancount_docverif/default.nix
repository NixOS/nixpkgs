        Docverif is the "Document Verification" plugin for beancount, fulfilling the following functions:

        - Require that every transaction touching an account have an accompanying document on disk.
        - Explictly declare the name of a document accompanying a transaction.
        - Explicitly declare that a transaction is expected not to have an accompanying document.
        - Look for an "implicit" PDF document matching transaction data.
        - Associate (and require) a document with any type of entry, including open entries themselves.
        - Guarantee integrity: verify that every document declared does in fact exist on disk.
