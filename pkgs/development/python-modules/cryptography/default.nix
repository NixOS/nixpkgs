      Cryptography includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to
      common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message
      digests, and key derivation functions.
      Our goal is for it to be your "cryptographic standard library". It
      supports Python 2.7, Python 3.5+, and PyPy 5.4+.
