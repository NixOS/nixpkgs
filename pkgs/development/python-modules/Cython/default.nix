    # compiler changes to use them in Cython-emitted code. The latter
    # change is still useful, but the former has been upstreamed as of
    # Python 3.8, and the patch below makes Cython use the upstream
    # trashcan macros whenever available. This is needed for Python
    # 3.11 support, because the API used in Cython's implementation
