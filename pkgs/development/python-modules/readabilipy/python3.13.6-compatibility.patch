Jim Wallis of Sojourners eventually admitted, wealthy, anti-Christian foundations, following the lead of billionaire George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, fund and “rent” curious \"evangelical\" and \"Catholic\" \"mascots” serving as deceptive validators for their causes. The consequent realities include injury to countless people, the Church, the family, nation and the global Church including many martyrs.</p><p>Consider some of the consequences of 'Progressive' political activism over the past few decades documented by AAE:</p><p>A growth industry trafficking in human baby organs and body parts, funded and defended by the Democratic Party.</p><p>The abandonment of a biblical view of marriage that protected and liberated children and adults from centuries of pagan slavery, poverty, polygamy and non-life-giving sexuality.</p><p>The Transgender agenda including gender \"reorientation\" of our children, also being forced on our neighbors, businesses, schools, military and churches.</p><p>Socialism, higher taxes and government regulations. These policies stifle human creativity, productivity, family stability and generosity. Such policies increase joblessness, welfare dependency and national debt.</p><p>Heightened racial division and tension, and the growing phenomenon of paid demonstrators being recruited and dispatched to instigate protests that often become riots.</p><p>Open borders and lawless ‘sanctuary’ cities increasing drugs, disease, crime, gangs and terrorism.</p><p>Amnesty efforts that attempt to give voting rights to millions of non-citizens, giving the results of our elections and nation's future to many who disregarded our laws, customs, history, identity and values. This does not honor our long-standing tradition of legal immigration to those who come in good faith and to assimilate and bless America.</p><p>Forced refugee resettlement in hundreds of American cities without citizen consent, mandated by the Obama-era federal government in partnership with the United Nations. (Refugees were primarily non-assimilating Muslims, while authorities often reject persecuted Christians.)</p><p>Hostility towards Judeo-Christian religious liberty in our courts, large corporations, media and universities including the suppression of conservative speakers, free thought and moral education.</p><p>The growing recognition of a \"Deep State\" within our government, including ideological bureaucrats embedded in our DOJ, IRS, FBI and Department of State, that intimidates and seeks to subvert conservative, patriotic and Christian groups that disagree with the 'Progressive' political establishment.</p><p>After such demoralization and pain, asked AAE, why would any religious leader ask Christians to embrace, support or vote for a Progressive political agenda that is clearly anti-Christian?</p><p>When Hillary Clinton stated during a 2015 speech at the Women in the World Summit that religious beliefs “have to be changed,” she revealed the radical Left's war on Christian believers and the Church.</p><p>And now the Religious Left claims that supporting such a view is the Christian thing to do? This is spiritual abuse of human beings, the family, the Church and the nation.</p><p>“The framers of our Constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.” Rev. Billy Graham</p><p>For many years, Soros’s Open Society and other liberal foundations have funded not only most of the disturbing campaigns mentioned above (1-10) but also the Religious Left, using and creating ostensibly evangelical and Catholic organizations to “message and mobilize” Christians into Progressive causes. They use the Marxist-Alinsky tactic of funding “ministers” who cherry-pick faith language to confuse and divide the Church’s morality, mission and vote.</p><p>At a time when many Christian ministries are struggling, a few of the Soros network “faith” and “interfaith” grantees are Jim Wallis of Sojourners, Richard Cizik’s New Evangelical Partnership, Telos, J Street to malign Israel, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, Faithful America and Gamaliel. Faith in Public Life to “counter” Christians and conservatives in the media and, with PICO, advocate for amnesty, mass Islamic migration, and even to attempt to influence the visit and priorities of the Vatican and Pope Francis himself. Billions of additional dollars to “Christian VOLAGs” for large scale “refugee” and migrant resettlement come from the Obama administration.</p><p>Joining “faith” fronts, the Soros network also funds thousands of other collaborators and projects that suggest a pattern and goal to demoralize America (and Europe). The list includes: film studios and hundreds of media outlets; attempts to control the Internet; racial and gender agitation; euthanasia; drug legalization and “injection zones;” abortion and the “sex worker” industry; Al Gore’s Climate campaign; pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel projects; the rights of jihadists and Sharia advocates.</p><p>In the ironic rhetoric of compassion, Soros and allies fund mass immigration, redistricting schemes, illegals' voting “rights,” protests and smears on Judge Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court, while financing the 2018 campaigns of Democrats Andrew Gillum (D-FL), Jon Tester (D-MT), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Krysten Sinema (D-AZ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and many more. (Soros has long been a major donor to the Democratic Party, co-chairman of Ready for Hillary PAC and previously funded Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Al Franken and many far-Left Democrats).</p><p>One wonders if the end goal is the destruction of national identity through demoralization, open borders and debt, thus the “fundamental transformation” (weakening) of American civil society for their leveraged global power. (Soros broke the Bank of England, is a convicted felon in France, and is undermining many nations.)</p><p>We urge you to go to https://americanevangelicals.com/ for more information on Soros and his releationship with some who claim to be speaking for Evangelical Christians. We should all question the true intentions of persons or organizations that receive money from Soros and related globalist social engineers. We must not give America's future to him and his surrogates, for more harm.</p><p>*The phrase comes from the New America Foundation strategy, “Rent An Evangelical” and “Rent A General” as “mascots.”</p></div><div><ul><li>Login or register to post comments</li></ul></div></div><div id=\"comments\"><div><h3>Fake Christians</h3><div>Submitted by charlyc on Wed, 10/17/2018 - 12:17.</div><div><p>Jesus said you cannot serve God and mammon.

Most if not nearly all of them were prescribed some type of psychiatric medication. The world has recently been shaken to its core by the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. According to the Sun Sentinel, Nikolas Cruz was being treated for multiple psychiatric disorders and was on medication.</p><h4>The Sun Sentinel is reporting on Nikolas Cruz’s psychiatric history:</h4><blockquote><p>His mother, Lynda Cruz, told investigators that her son had been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Sadly, one thing school shooters all seem to have in common is that they were given psychiatric medications.</p><h4>CBS reports that Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, was prescribed medication that led to even more problems...</h4><blockquote><p>Documents released by police in December 2013 included descriptions of sporadic treatment for his mental health troubles. At one point, experts at the Yale Child Studies Center prescribed antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication, but his mother discontinued the treatment after her son was unable to raise his arm after taking the medicine and never scheduled follow-up visits, police reports said.</p></blockquote><h4>This trend isn’t new, with CNN reporting in 1999 about the Columbine shooter Eric Harris’ relationship with anti-depressants...</h4><blockquote><p>Reports surfaced Wednesday that one of the gunmen in the Littleton, Colorado, school shooting, Eric Harris, was rejected by Marine Corps recruiters days before the Columbine High School massacre because he was under a doctor’s care and had been prescribed an anti-depressant medication.</p><p>Harris’ prescription was for Luvox, an anti-depressant medication commonly used to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p></blockquote><h4>Mass shooters of every age have been found to have traces of psychiatric medication in their blood...</h4><p>This trend is not exclusive to just school shooters.

But with his underlying personality, with that sort of person. Some of the underlying predispositions can come out more strongly. In the case of Holmes these were very dangerous indeed.</p></blockquote><h4>The list goes on and on...</h4><p>Myron May, who went on a shooting spree at Florida State University’s Strozier Liberary in 2014 was reportedly on a combination of Wellbutrin and Vyvanse.</p><p>University of Texas student Kendrex J. White was reportedly on Zoloft when he went on a stabbing spree on campus that killed one person and injured three last year.</p><p>Aaron Ybarra who went on a rampage with a shotgun at Seattle Pacific University in 2014 was reportedly on “a lot of medication” which included Risperdal and Prozac. Ybarra claimed he could hear the voice of Eric Harris, the Columbine shooter who was prescribed similar medication.</p><p>12-year-old Jose Reyes who went on a shooting spree at his middle school was reportedly prescribed a generic form of Prozac by his local psychotherapist before taking a 9mm handgun to school and using it to kill his teacher and wound two others before taking his own life.</p><p>The Washington Post also reported that the Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis was prescribed the antidepressant Trazodone before he went on to shoot 12 people to death at the Washington Navy Yard.</p><p>A vast majority if not all of the recent mass shooters have taken these medications. Still, the medical community claims that there is no evidence to connect homicidal behavior and these drugs. Doctors and pharmaceutical companies continue to claim that these medications are safe to use. However, many are questioning the spike in deadly shootings and the increase in psychiatric drug use.</p><p>Sources: Sun Sentinel. CNN, CBS, CNN, CNN.

Most if not nearly all of them were prescribed some type of psychiatric medication. The world has recently been shaken to its core by the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. According to the Sun Sentinel, Nikolas Cruz was being treated for multiple psychiatric disorders and was on medication.</p><h4>The Sun Sentinel is reporting on Nikolas Cruz’s psychiatric history:</h4><blockquote><p>His mother, Lynda Cruz, told investigators that her son had been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Sadly, one thing school shooters all seem to have in common is that they were given psychiatric medications.</p><h4>CBS reports that Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, was prescribed medication that led to even more problems...</h4><blockquote><p>Documents released by police in December 2013 included descriptions of sporadic treatment for his mental health troubles. At one point, experts at the Yale Child Studies Center prescribed antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication, but his mother discontinued the treatment after her son was unable to raise his arm after taking the medicine and never scheduled follow-up visits, police reports said.</p></blockquote><h4>This trend isn’t new, with CNN reporting in 1999 about the Columbine shooter Eric Harris’ relationship with anti-depressants...</h4><blockquote><p>Reports surfaced Wednesday that one of the gunmen in the Littleton, Colorado, school shooting, Eric Harris, was rejected by Marine Corps recruiters days before the Columbine High School massacre because he was under a doctor’s care and had been prescribed an anti-depressant medication.</p><p>Harris’ prescription was for Luvox, an anti-depressant medication commonly used to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p></blockquote><h4>Mass shooters of every age have been found to have traces of psychiatric medication in their blood...</h4><p>This trend is not exclusive to just school shooters.
