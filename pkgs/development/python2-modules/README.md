# Python 2 is Not Supported

Packages, applications, and services based on Python 2 are no longer supported and are being removed. If you require a Python 2 based package, you can include that package in your own local repository.

Some packages may continue to be maintained for internal use by nixpkgs, but they should not be used by new public packages.

For more details, see [Issue #201859](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/201859).
