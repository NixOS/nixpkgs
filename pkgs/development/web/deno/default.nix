      Deno aims to be a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern programmer.
      Deno will always be distributed as a single executable.
      Given a URL to a Deno program, it is runnable with nothing more than the ~15 megabyte zipped executable.
      Deno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager.
      It uses a standard browser-compatible protocol for loading modules: URLs.
      Among other things, Deno is a great replacement for utility scripts that may have been historically written with
      bash or python.
