      The Open Policy Agent (OPA, pronounced "oh-pa") is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies
      policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that letâ€™s you specify policy
      as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. You can use OPA to enforce policies
      in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.
