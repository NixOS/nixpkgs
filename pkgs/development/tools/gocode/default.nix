      Gocode is a helper tool which is intended to be integrated with your
      source code editor, like vim, neovim and emacs. It provides several
      advanced capabilities, which currently includes:

        - Context-sensitive autocompletion

      It is called daemon, because it uses client/server architecture for
      caching purposes. In particular, it makes autocompletions very fast.
      Typical autocompletion time with warm cache is 30ms, which is barely
      noticeable.
