      Build and publish Rust crates with PyO3, rust-cpython, and
      cffi bindings as well as Rust binaries as Python packages.

      This project is meant as a zero-configuration replacement for
      setuptools-rust and Milksnake. It supports building wheels for
      Python and can upload them to PyPI.
