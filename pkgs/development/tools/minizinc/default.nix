    longDescription = ''
      MiniZinc is a medium-level constraint modelling
      language. It is high-level enough to express most
      constraint problems easily, but low-level enough
      that it can be mapped onto existing solvers easily and consistently.
      It is a subset of the higher-level language Zinc.
