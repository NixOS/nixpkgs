        The Ammonite-REPL is an improved Scala REPL, re-implemented from first principles.
        It is much more featureful than the default REPL and comes
        with a lot of ergonomic improvements and configurability
        that may be familiar to people coming from IDEs or other REPLs such as IPython or Zsh.
