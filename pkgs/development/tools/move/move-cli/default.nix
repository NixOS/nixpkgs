            Move is a programming language for writing safe smart contracts originally
            developed at Facebook to power the Diem blockchain. Move is designed to be
            a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and
            developer communities across diverse blockchains with vastly different
            data and execution models.
