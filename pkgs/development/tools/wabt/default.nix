      WABT (pronounced "wabbit") is a suite of tools for WebAssembly, including:
       * wat2wasm: translate from WebAssembly text format to the WebAssembly
         binary format
       * wasm2wat: the inverse of wat2wasm, translate from the binary format
         back to the text format (also known as a .wat)
       * wasm-objdump: print information about a wasm binary. Similiar to
         objdump.
       * wasm-interp: decode and run a WebAssembly binary file using a
         stack-based interpreter
       * wat-desugar: parse .wat text form as supported by the spec interpreter
         (s-expressions, flat syntax, or mixed) and print "canonical" flat
         format
       * wasm2c: convert a WebAssembly binary file to a C source and header
    '';
