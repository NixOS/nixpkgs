      Help other developers use your project. A CMake script for packaging
      C/C++ projects for simple project installation while employing
      best-practices for maximum compatibility. Creating installable
      CMake scripts always requires a large amount of boilerplate code
      to get things working. This small script should simplify the CMake
      packaging process into a single, easy-to-use command.
