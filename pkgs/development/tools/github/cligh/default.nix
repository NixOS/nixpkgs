        Cligh is a simple command-line interface to the facilities of GitHub.
        It is written by Christopher Brannon chris@the-brannons.com. The
        current version is 0.3, released July 23, 2016. This program is still
        in the early stage of development. It is by no means feature-complete.
        A friend and I consider it useful, but others may not.
