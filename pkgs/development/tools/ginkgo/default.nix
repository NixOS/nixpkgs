    longDescription = ''
      Ginkgo is a testing framework for Go designed to help you write expressive
      tests. It is best paired with the Gomega matcher library. When combined,
      Ginkgo and Gomega provide a rich and expressive DSL
      (Domain-specific Language) for writing tests.

      Ginkgo is sometimes described as a "Behavior Driven Development" (BDD)
      framework. In reality, Ginkgo is a general purpose testing framework in
      active use across a wide variety of testing contexts: unit tests,
      integration tests, acceptance test, performance tests, etc.
