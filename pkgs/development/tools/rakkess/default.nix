      Have you ever wondered what access rights you have on a provided
      kubernetes cluster? For single resources you can use
      `kubectl auth can-i list deployments`, but maybe you are looking for a
      complete overview? This is what rakkess is for. It lists access rights for
      the current user and all server resources, similar to
      `kubectl auth can-i --list`.
