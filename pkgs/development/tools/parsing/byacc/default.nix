    longDescription = ''
      Berkeley Yacc (byacc) is generally conceded to be the best yacc variant
      available. In contrast to bison, it is written to avoid dependencies upon
      a particular compiler.

      Byacc was written around 1990 by Robert Corbett who is the original author
      of bison. Byacc is noted in Lex & Yacc by John Levine et al (O'Reilly,
      1992) for its compatibility with the original yacc program.

      Nowadays byacc is maintained by Thomas E. Dickey.
