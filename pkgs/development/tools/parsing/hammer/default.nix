      Hammer is a parsing library. Like many modern parsing libraries,
      it provides a parser combinator interface for writing grammars
      as inline domain-specific languages, but Hammer also provides a
      variety of parsing backends. It's also bit-oriented rather than
      character-oriented, making it ideal for parsing binary data such
      as images, network packets, audio, and executables.
