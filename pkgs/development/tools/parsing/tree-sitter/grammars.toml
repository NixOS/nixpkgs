# Additional grammars that are not in the official github orga.
# If you need a grammar that already exists in the official orga,

# This can be type == "github", then it needs an orga and a repo.
#
# Or it can be type == "gitlab", then it needs a projectId,
# which you can find under the repository name on gitlab.
