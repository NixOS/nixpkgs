    longDescription = ''
      Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an
      annotated context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for
      that grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use
      it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used
      in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.

      Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc
      grammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone
      familiar with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little
      trouble.  You need to be fluent in C or C++ programming in order
      to use Bison.
