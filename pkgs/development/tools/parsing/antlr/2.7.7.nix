      ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser
      generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured
      text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and
      frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and
      walk parse trees.
