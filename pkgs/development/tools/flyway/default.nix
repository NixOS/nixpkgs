      The Flyway command-line tool is a standalone Flyway distribution.
      It is primarily meant for users who wish to migrate their database from the command-line
      without having to integrate Flyway into their applications nor having to install a build tool.

      This package is only the Community Edition of the Flyway command-line tool.
