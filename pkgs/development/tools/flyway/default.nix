          The Flyway command-line tool is a standalone Flyway distribution.
          It is primarily meant for users who wish to migrate their database from the command-line
          without having to integrate Flyway into their applications nor having to install a build tool.

          This package is only the Community Edition of the Flyway command-line tool.
