      SCons is an Open Source software construction tool. Think of
      SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the classic
      Make utility with integrated functionality similar to
      autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short,
      SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way to build
      software.
