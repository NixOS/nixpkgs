    '' SCons is an Open Source software construction tool. Think of
       SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the classic
       Make utility with integrated functionality similar to
       autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short,
       SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way to build
       software.
