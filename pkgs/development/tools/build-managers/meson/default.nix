      Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast, and,
      even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.

      The main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends
      writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every
      second spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling
      code.
