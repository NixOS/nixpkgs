    # In common distributions, RPATH is only needed for internal libraries so
    # meson removes everything else. With Nix, the locations of libraries
    # are not as predictable, therefore we need to keep them in the RPATH.
    # At the moment we are keeping the paths starting with /nix/store.

    # cut-in-half-by-\0 store path references.
