      build2 is an open source (MIT), cross-platform build toolchain
      that aims to approximate Rust Cargo's convenience for developing
      and packaging C/C++ projects while providing more depth and
      flexibility, especially in the build system.

      build2 is a hierarchy of tools consisting of a general-purpose
      build system, package manager (for package consumption), and
      project manager (for project development). It is primarily aimed
      at C/C++ projects as well as mixed-language projects involving
      one of these languages (see bash and rust modules, for example).
