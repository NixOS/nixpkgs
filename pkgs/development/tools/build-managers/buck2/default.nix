  # NOTE (aseipp): buck2 uses a precompiled binary build for good reason â€” the
  # upstream codebase extensively uses unstable `rustc` nightly features, and as
  # a result can't be built upstream in any sane manner. it is only ever tested
  # and integrated against a single version of the compiler, which produces all
  # usable binaries. you shouldn't try to workaround this or get clever and
  # think you can patch it to work; just accept it for now. it is extremely
  # unlikely buck2 will build with a stable compiler anytime soon; see related
  # upstream issues:
  #
  #   - NixOS/nixpkgs#226677
  #   - NixOS/nixpkgs#232471
  #   - facebook/buck2#265
  #   - facebook/buck2#322
  #
  # worth noting: it *is* possible to build buck2 from source using
  # buildRustPackage, and it works fine, but only if you are using flakes and
  # can import `rust-overlay` from somewhere else to vendor your compiler. See
  # nixos/nixpkgs#226677 for more information about that.
