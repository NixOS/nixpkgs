      A build system that uses ptrace to handle dependencies automatically
    '';
    longDescription = ''
      Fac is a general-purpose build system inspired by make that utilizes
      ptrace to ensure that all dependences are enumerated and that all
      source files are added to a (git) repo. An important feature of fac
      is that it automatically handles dependencies, rather than either
      complaining about them or giving an incorrect build. Currently, fac
      only runs on linux systems, but on those systems it is incredibly
      easy to use!
