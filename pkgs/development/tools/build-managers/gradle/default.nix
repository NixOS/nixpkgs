      Gradle is a build system which offers you ease, power and freedom.
      You can choose the balance for yourself. It has powerful multi-project
      build support. It has a layer on top of Ivy that provides a 
      build-by-convention integration for Ivy. It gives you always the choice
      between the flexibility of Ant and the convenience of a 
      build-by-convention behavior.
