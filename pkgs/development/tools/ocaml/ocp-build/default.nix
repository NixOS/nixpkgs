  # fix the bug in the precompiled bootstrap version of ocp-build that is

  # it's also fixed upstream, we simply set TERM to some valid entry in the

      ocp-build is a build system for OCaml application, based on simple
      descriptions of packages. ocp-build combines the descriptions of
      packages, and optimize the parallel compilation of files depending on
      the number of cores and the automatically-inferred dependencies
      between source files.
