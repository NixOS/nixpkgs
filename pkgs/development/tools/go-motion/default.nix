      Motion is a tool that was designed to work with editors. It is providing
      contextual information for a given offset(option) from a file or
      directory of files. Editors can use these informations to implement
      navigation, text editing, etc... that are specific to a Go source code.

      It's optimized and created to work with vim-go, but it's designed to work
      with any editor. It's currently work in progress and open to change.
