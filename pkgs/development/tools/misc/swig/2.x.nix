    longDescription = ''
       SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and
       C++ with languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, Scheme, and Tcl.  It
       works by taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using
       them to generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to
       access the underlying C/C++ code.  In addition, SWIG provides a variety
       of customization features that let you tailor the wrapping process to
       suit your application.
