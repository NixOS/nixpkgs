      DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose
      is to provide a single front end for all tests.  Think of it as a
      custom library of Tcl procedures crafted to support writing a
      test harness.  A test harness is the testing infrastructure that
      is created to support a specific program or tool.  Each program
      can have multiple testsuites, all supported by a single test
      harness.  DejaGnu is written in Expect, which in turn uses Tcl --
      Tool command language.
