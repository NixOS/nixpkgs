      BonnMotion is a Java software which creates and analyzes mobility
      scenarios and is most commonly used as a tool for the investigation of
      mobile ad hoc network characteristics. The scenarios can also be exported
      for several network simulators, such as ns-2, ns-3, GloMoSim/QualNet,
      COOJA, MiXiM, and ONE.
