      C-Reduce is a tool that takes a large C or C++ program that has a
      property of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and
      automatically produces a much smaller C/C++ program that has the same
      property.  It is intended for use by people who discover and report
      bugs in compilers and other tools that process C/C++ code.
