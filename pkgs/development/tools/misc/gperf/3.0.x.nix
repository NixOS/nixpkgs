    longDescription = ''
      GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator.  For a given
      list of strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in
      form of C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the
      input string.  The hash function is perfect, which means that
      the hash table has no collisions, and the hash table lookup
      needs a single string comparison only.

      GNU gperf is highly customizable.  There are options for
      generating C or C++ code, for emitting switch statements or
      nested ifs instead of a hash table, and for tuning the algorithm
      employed by gperf.
