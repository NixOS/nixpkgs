      pmccabe calculates McCabe-style cyclomatic complexity for C and
      C++ source code.  Per-function complexity may be used for
      spotting likely trouble spots and for estimating testing
      effort.

      pmccabe also includes a non-commented line counter, decomment which
      only removes comments from source code; codechanges, a program to
      calculate the amount of change which has occurred between two source
      trees or files; and vifn, to invoke vi given a function name rather
      than a file name.
