      Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found
      in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily
      located by a text editor or other utility.  A tag signifies a
      language object for which an index entry is available (or,
      alternatively, the index entry created for that object).  Many
      programming languages are supported.
