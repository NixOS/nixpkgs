      GNU cflow analyzes a collection of C source files and prints a
      graph, charting control flow within the program.

      GNU cflow is able to produce both direct and inverted flowgraphs
      for C sources.  Optionally a cross-reference listing can be
      generated.  Two output formats are implemented: POSIX and GNU
      (extended).

      The package also provides Emacs major mode for examining the
      produced flowcharts in Emacs.
