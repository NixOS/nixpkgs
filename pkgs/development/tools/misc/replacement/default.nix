        Replacement is a python utility
        that parses a yaml template and outputs text.

        A 'template' is a YAML file containing a 'replacement' object.

        A 'replacement' object contains a list of blocks,
        each of which is executed in sequence.

        This tool is useful in generating configuration files,
        static websites and the like.
