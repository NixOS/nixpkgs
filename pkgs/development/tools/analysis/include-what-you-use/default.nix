      For every symbol (type, function variable, or macro) that you use in
      foo.cc, either foo.cc or foo.h should #include a .h file that exports the
      declaration of that symbol.  The main goal of include-what-you-use is to
      remove superfluous #includes, both by figuring out what #includes are not
      actually needed for this file (for both .cc and .h files), and by
      replacing #includes with forward-declares when possible.
