    longDescription = ''
      Splint is a tool for statically checking C programs for security
      vulnerabilities and coding mistakes.  With minimal effort, Splint
      can be used as a better lint.  If additional effort is invested
      adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform stronger
      checking than can be done by any standard lint.
