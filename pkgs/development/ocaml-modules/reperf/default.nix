      Inspired by the core_bench tools from Janestreet.

      reperf helps with:
      * Timing: time spent in a code block
      * Call count: frequency of code-path calls
      * Allocations: code-block impact to garbage collector

      Supports benchmarks, which are test cases that exercise performance scenarios.
      Outputs a JSON performance report, and compare it with previous iterations - and fail if a regression is detected.
