    Lambda-term is a cross-platform library for
    manipulating the terminal. It provides an abstraction for keys,
    mouse events, colors, as well as a set of widgets to write
    curses-like applications.

    The main objective of lambda-term is to provide a higher level
    functional interface to terminal manipulation than, for example,
    ncurses, by providing a native OCaml interface instead of bindings to
    a C library.

    Lambda-term integrates with zed to provide text edition facilities in
    console applications.
