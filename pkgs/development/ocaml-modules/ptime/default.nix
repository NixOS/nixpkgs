    longDescription = ''
      Ptime has platform independent POSIX time support in pure OCaml.
      It provides a type to represent a well-defined range of POSIX timestamps
      with picosecond precision, conversion with date-time values, conversion
      with RFC 3339 timestamps and pretty printing to a human-readable,
      locale-independent representation.

      The additional Ptime_clock library provides access to a system POSIX clock
      and to the system's current time zone offset.

      Ptime is not a calendar library.
