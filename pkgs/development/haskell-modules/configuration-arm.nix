# ARM-SPECIFIC OVERRIDES FOR THE HASKELL PACKAGE SET IN NIXPKGS
#
# This extension is applied to all haskell package sets in nixpkgs
# if `stdenv.hostPlatform.isAarch32 || stdenv.hostPlatform.isAarch64`
# to apply arm specific workarounds or fixes.
#
# The file is split into three parts:
#
# * Overrides that are applied for all arm platforms
# * Overrides for aarch32 platforms
# * Overrides for aarch64 platforms
#
# This may be extended in the future to also include compiler-
# specific sections as compiler and linker related bugs may
# get fixed subsequently.
#
# When adding new overrides, try to research which section they
# belong into. Most likely we'll be favouring aarch64 overrides
# in practice since that is the only platform we can test on
# Hydra. Also take care to group overrides by the issue they
# solve, so refactors and updates to this file are less tedious.
