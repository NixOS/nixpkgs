/*
Notes on specific dependencies:
- if/when python2.7 is removed from nixpkgs, this may need to figure
  out how to build oil's vendored python2
- I'm not sure if glibcLocales is worth the addition here. It's to fix
  a libc test oil runs. My oil fork just disabled the libc tests, but
  I haven't quite decided if that's the right long-term call, so I
  didn't add a patch for it here yet.
