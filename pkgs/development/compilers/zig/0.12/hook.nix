    # This zig_default_flags below is meant to avoid CPU feature impurity in
    # Nixpkgs. However, this flagset is "unstable": it is specifically meant to
    # be controlled by the upstream development team - being up to that team
    # exposing or not that flags to the outside (especially the package manager
    # teams).

    # Because of this hurdle, @andrewrk from Zig Software Foundation proposed
    # some solutions for this issue. Hopefully they will be implemented in
    # future releases of Zig. When this happens, this flagset should be
    # revisited accordingly.

    # in Nixpkgs:
