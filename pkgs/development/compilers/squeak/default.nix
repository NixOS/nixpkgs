      Squeak is a full-featured implementation of the Smalltalk programming
      language and environment based on (and largely compatible with) the
      original Smalltalk-80 system. Squeak has very powerful 2- and 3-D
      graphics, sound, video, MIDI, animation and other multimedia
      capabilities. It also includes a customisable framework for creating
      dynamic HTTP servers and interactively extensible Web sites.
