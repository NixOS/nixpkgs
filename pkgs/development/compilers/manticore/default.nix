    longDescription = '' 
      Manticore is a high-level parallel programming language aimed at
      general-purpose applications running on multi-core
      processors. Manticore supports parallelism at multiple levels:
      explicit concurrency and coarse-grain parallelism via CML-style
      constructs and fine-grain parallelism via various light-weight
      notations, such as parallel tuple expressions and NESL/Nepal-style
      parallel array comprehensions.
