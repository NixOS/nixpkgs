      For an enduring period of time the options for a decent compiler for
      the Quake C programming language were confined to a specific compiler
      known as QCC. Attempts were made to extend and improve upon the design
      of QCC, but many foreseen the consequences of building on a broken
      foundation. The solution was obvious, a new compiler; one born from
      the NIH realm of sarcastic wit.
      We welcome you. You won't find a better Quake C compiler.
