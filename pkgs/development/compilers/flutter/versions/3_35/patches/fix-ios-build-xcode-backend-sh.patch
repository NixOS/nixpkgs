Subject: [PATCH] fix: cleanup xcode_backend.sh to fix iOS build w/
 `NixOS/nixpkgs` flutter

This patch cleans up `xcode_backend.sh`. It now effectively just runs
`exec $FLUTTER_ROOT/bin/dart ./xcode_backend.dart`.

The previous `xcode_backend.sh` tries to discover `$FLUTTER_ROOT` from
argv[0], even though its presence is already guaranteed (the wrapped
`xcode_backend.dart` also relies on this env).

When using nixpkgs flutter, the flutter SDK directory is composed of several
layers, joined together using symlinks (called a `symlinkJoin`). Without this
patch, the auto-discover traverses the symlinks into the wrong layer, and so it
uses an "unwrapped" `dart` command instead of a "wrapped" dart that sets some
important envs/flags (like `$FLUTTER_ROOT`).

Using the "unwrapped" dart then manifests in this error when compiling, since
it doesn't see the ios build-support artifacts:

```
$ flutter run -d iphone
Running Xcode build...
Xcode build done.                                            6.4s
Failed to build iOS app
Error (Xcode): Target debug_unpack_ios failed: Error: Flutter failed to create a directory at "/<nix-store>/XXXX-flutter-3.24.1-unwrapped/bin/cache/artifacts".
```
