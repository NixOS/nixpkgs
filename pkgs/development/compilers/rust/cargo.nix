  # Upstream rustc still assumes that musl = static[1].  The fix for
  # this is to disable crt-static by default for non-static musl
  # targets.
  #
  # For every package apart from Cargo, we can fix this by just
  # patching rustc to not have crt-static by default.  But Cargo is
  # built with the upstream bootstrap binary for rustc, which we can't
  # easily patch.  This means we need to find another way to make sure
  # crt-static is not used during the build of pkgsMusl.cargo.
  #
  # By default, Cargo doesn't apply RUSTFLAGS when building build.rs
  # if --target is passed, so the only good way to set -crt-static for
  # build.rs files used in the Cargo build is to use the unstable
  # -Zhost-config Cargo feature.  This allows us to specify flags that
  # should be passed to rustc when building for the build platform.
  # We also need to use -Ztarget-applies-to-host, because using
  # -Zhost-config requires it.
  #
  # When doing this, we also have to specify the linker, or cargo
  # won't pass a -C linker= argument to rustc.  This will make rustc
  # try to use its default value of "cc", which won't be available
  # when cross-compiling.
