# On x86_64-darwin, the gnat-bootstrap bootstrap compiler that we need to build a
# native GCC with Ada support emits assembly that is accepted by the Clang
# integrated assembler, but not by the GNU assembler in cctools-port that Nix
# usually in the x86_64-darwin stdenv.  In particular, x86_64-darwin gnat-bootstrap
# emits MOVQ as the mnemonic for quadword interunit moves, such as between XMM
# and general registers (e.g "movq %xmm0, %rbp"); the cctools-port assembler,
# however, only recognises MOVD for such moves.
#
# Therefore, for native x86_64-darwin builds that support Ada, we have to use
# the Clang integrated assembler to build (at least stage 1 of) GCC, but have to
# target GCC at the cctools-port GNU assembler.  In the wrapped x86_64-darwin
# gnat-bootstrap, the former is provided as `as`, while the latter is provided as
# `gas`.

# NOTE 2020/3/18: This environment variable prevents configure scripts from
# detecting the presence of aligned_alloc on Darwin.  There are many facts that
# collectively make this fix necessary:
#  - Nix uses a fixed set of standard library headers on all MacOS systems,
#    regardless of their actual version.  (Nix uses version 10.12 headers.)
#  - Nix uses the native standard library binaries for the build system.  That
#    means the standard library binaries may not exactly match the standard
#    library headers.
#  - The aligned_alloc procedure is present in MacOS 10.15 (Catalina), but not
#    in earlier versions.  Therefore on Catalina systems, aligned_alloc is
#    linkable (i.e. present in the binary libraries) but not present in the
#    headers.
#  - Configure scripts detect a procedure's existence by checking whether it is
#    linkable.  They do not check whether it is present in the headers.
#  - GCC throws an error during compilation because aligned_alloc is not
#    defined in the headers---even though the linker can see it.
#
# This fix would not be necessary if ANY of the above were false:
#  - If Nix used native headers for each different MacOS version, aligned_alloc
#    would be in the headers on Catalina.
#  - If Nix used the same library binaries for each MacOS version, aligned_alloc
#    would not be in the library binaries.
#  - If Catalina did not include aligned_alloc, this wouldn't be a problem.
#  - If the configure scripts looked for header presence as well as
#    linkability, they would see that aligned_alloc is missing.
#  - If GCC allowed implicit declaration of symbols, it would not fail during
#    compilation even if the configure scripts did not check header presence.
