As originally implemented, the error message check
described in the configure script
breaks detection of Ada compiler support on x86_64-darwin,
because the assembler in the version of cctools currently used
unconditionally emits a deprecation message to stdout,
with no way to disable it.

Furthermore, GCC 3.4 was the minimum version needed to build GNAT
as far back as GCC 4.4 (see the GCC git repo, tags/releases/gcc-4.4.0,
gcc/doc/install.texi, lines 2052-2053 [1]);
GCC 3.4 is newer than any of the broken GCC versions
that the configure script works around
(see the part of the comment in the configure script
before the context in the patch below),
and GCC 4.4 is older than any GCC that Nix currently packages (GCC 4.8).

We therefore choose to not check for error messages,
and just check for an error code.
There's no harm in still checking for an object file being created, though.
