Subject: [PATCH] libsanitizer: Fix build with glibc 2.42

The termio structure will be removed from glibc 2.42.  It has
been deprecated since the late 80s/early 90s.

Cherry-picked from LLVM commit 59978b21ad9c65276ee8e14f26759691b8a65763
("[sanitizer_common] Remove interceptors for deprecated struct termio
(#137403)").
