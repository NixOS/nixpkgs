    longDescription = ''
      PAKCS is an implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language
      Curry jointly developed by the Portland State University, the Aachen
      University of Technology, and the University of Kiel. Although this is
      not a highly optimized implementation but based on a high-level
      compilation of Curry programs into Prolog programs, it is not a toy
      implementation but has been used for a variety of applications (e.g.,
      graphical programming environments, an object-oriented front-end for
      Curry, partial evaluators, database applications, HTML programming
      with dynamic web pages, prototyping embedded systems).
