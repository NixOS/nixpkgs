Subject: [PATCH] emulate clang 'sysroot + /include' logic

Authored-By: Alexander Khovansky <alex@khovansky.me>
Co-Authored-By: Yureka <yuka@yuka.dev>

Clang provided by nix patches out logic that appends 'sysroot + /include'
to the include path as well as automatic inclusion of libcxx includes (/include/c++/v1).
The patch below adds that logic back by introducing cflags emulating this behavior to emcc
invocations directly.

Important note: with non-nix clang, sysroot/include dir ends up being the last
in the include search order, right after the resource root.
Hence usage of -idirafter. Clang also documents an -isystem-after flag
but it doesn't appear to work
