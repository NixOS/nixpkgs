  # The build generates object files (`.x`) from module files (`.m`).
  # To be able to invalidate object file, it contains the `mtime`
  # of the corresponding module file at the time of the build.
  # When a file is installed to Nix store its `mtime` is set to `1`,
  # so the `mtime` field in the object file would no longer match
  # and Miranda would try to regenerate it at the runtime,
  # even though it is up to date.
  # Using `fetchzip` will make all the source files have `mtime=1`
  # from the start so this mismatch cannot occur.
