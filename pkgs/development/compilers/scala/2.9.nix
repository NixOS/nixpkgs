    longDescription = ''
      Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express
      common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.
      It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional
      languages, enabling Java and other programmers to be more productive.
      Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when
      compared to an equivalent Java application.
