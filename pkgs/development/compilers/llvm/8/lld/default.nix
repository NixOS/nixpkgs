      LLD is a linker from the LLVM project that is a drop-in replacement for
      system linkers and runs much faster than them. It also provides features
      that are useful for toolchain developers.
      The linker supports ELF (Unix), PE/COFF (Windows), Mach-O (macOS), and
      WebAssembly in descending order of completeness. Internally, LLD consists
      of several different linkers.
