      The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
      toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with
      traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it
      is the full name of the project.
      LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the
      goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of
      supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming
      languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting
      of a number of subprojects, many of which are being used in production by
      a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being
      widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed
      under the "Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions".
