      Arachne-pnr implements the place and route step of
      the hardware compilation process for FPGAs. It
      accepts as input a technology-mapped netlist in BLIF
      format, as output by the Yosys [0] synthesis suite
      for example. It currently targets the Lattice
      Semiconductor iCE40 family of FPGAs [1]. Its output
      is a textual bitstream representation for assembly by
      the IceStorm [2] icepack command.
