    longDescription = ''
      The Factor programming language is a concatenative, stack-based
      programming language with high-level features including dynamic types,
      extensible syntax, macros, and garbage collection. On a practical side,
      Factor has a full-featured library, supports many different platforms, and
      has been extensively documented.

      The implementation is fully compiled for performance, while still
      supporting interactive development. Factor applications are portable
      between all common platforms. Factor can deploy stand-alone applications
      on all platforms. Full source code for the Factor project is available
      under a BSD license.
