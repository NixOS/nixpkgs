      Serpent is one of the high-level programming languages used to
      write Ethereum contracts. The language, as suggested by its name,
      is designed to be very similar to Python; it is intended to be
      maximally clean and simple, combining many of the efficiency
      benefits of a low-level language with ease-of-use in programming
      style, and at the same time adding special domain-specific
      features for contract programming.
