Idris packages
==============

This directory contains build rules for idris packages. In addition,
it contains several functions to build and compose those packages.
Everything is exposed to the user via the `idrisPackages` attribute.

callPackage
------------

This is like the normal nixpkgs callPackage function, specialized to
idris packages.

builtins
---------

This is a list of all of the libraries that come packaged with Idris
itself.

build-idris-package
--------------------

A function to build an idris package. Its sole argument is a set like
you might pass to `stdenv.mkDerivation`, except `build-idris-package`
sets several attributes for you. See `build-idris-package.nix` for
details.

build-builtin-package
----------------------

A version of `build-idris-package` specialized to builtin libraries.
Mostly for internal use.

with-packages
-------------

Bundle idris together with a list of packages. Example usage:

    $ nix-shell -p "idrisPackages.with-packages [ idrisPackages.lightyear ]"

Note that you still have to explicitly make the packages available to
idris when you run the interpreter, so to make lightyear accessible you
would start idris with the following command:

    $ idris -p lightyear
