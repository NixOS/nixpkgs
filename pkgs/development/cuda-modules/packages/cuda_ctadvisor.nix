      CUDA Compile Time Advisor (ctadvisor) analyzes trace files containing compilation time information generated by
      NVCC or NVRTC. ctadvisor identifies compilation bottlenecks that take significant amount of time, for examples,
      template instantiation and headers processing. The tool provides users with suggestions to reduce compilation
      time.
