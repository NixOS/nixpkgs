    longDescription = ''
      Homotopy Type Theory is an interpretation of Martin-Löf’s intensional
      type theory into abstract homotopy theory. Propositional equality is
      interpreted as homotopy and type isomorphism as homotopy equivalence.
      Logical constructions in type theory then correspond to
      homotopy-invariant constructions on spaces, while theorems and even
      proofs in the logical system inherit a homotopical meaning. As the
      natural logic of homotopy, type theory is also related to higher
      category theory as it is used e.g. in the notion of a higher topos.

      The HoTT library is a development of homotopy-theoretic ideas in the Coq
      proof assistant. It draws many ideas from Vladimir Voevodsky's
      Foundations library (which has since been incorporated into the Unimath
      library) and also cross-pollinates with the HoTT-Agda library.
