/*
Usage:

  You define you custom builder script by adding all build steps to a list.
  for example:
	builder = writeScript "fsg-4.4-builder"
		(textClosure [doUnpack addInputs preBuild doMake installPhase doForceShare]);

  a step is defined by noDepEntry, fullDepEntry or packEntry.
  To ensure that prerequisite are met those are added before the task itself by
  textClosureDupList. Duplicated items are removed again.

  See trace/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/top-level/builder-defs.nix for some predefined build steps
