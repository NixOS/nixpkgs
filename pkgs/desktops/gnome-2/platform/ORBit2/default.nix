      ORBit2 is a CORBA 2.4-compliant Object Request Broker (ORB) featuring
      mature C, C++ and Python bindings. Bindings (in various degrees of
      completeness) are also available for Perl, Lisp, Pascal, Ruby, and TCL;
      others are in-progress. It supports POA, DII, DSI, TypeCode, Any, IR and
      IIOP. Optional features including INS and threading are available. ORBit2
      is engineered for the desktop workstation environment, with a focus on
      performance, low resource usage, and security. The core ORB is written in
      C, and runs under Linux, UNIX (BSD, Solaris, HP-UX, ...), and Windows.
      ORBit2 is developed and released as open source software under GPL/LGPL.
