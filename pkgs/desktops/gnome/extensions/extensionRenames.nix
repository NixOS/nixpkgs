# A list of UUIDs that have the same pname and we need to rename them
# MAINTENANCE:
# - Every item from ./collisions.json (for the respective Shell version) should have an entry in here
# - Set the value to `null` for filtering (duplicate or unmaintained extensions)
# - Sort the entries in order of appearance in the collisions.json
# - Make a separate section for each GNOME version. Collisions will come back eventually
#   as the extensions are updated.
