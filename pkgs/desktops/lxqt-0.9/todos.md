TODOs:

- [ ] figure out how to make sure Qt sees the plugins from core/lxqt-qtplugin, and which directory should we install the plugins to?
    - see http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/deployment-plugins.html
    - see README in lxqt-qtplugin repository
- [ ] lxqt-common: I suppress the installation of .desktop session files for kdm/xdm; what should be done?
