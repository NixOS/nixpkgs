# This file defines the various standard build environments.
#
# On Linux systems, the standard build environment consists of
# Nix-built instances glibc and the `standard' Unix tools, i.e., the
# Posix utilities, the GNU C compiler, and so on.  On other systems,
# we use the native C library.

  # The native (i.e., impure) build environment.  This one uses the
  # tools installed on the system outside of the Nix environment,
  # i.e., the stuff in /bin, /usr/bin, etc.  This environment should
  # be used with care, since many Nix packages will not build properly
  # with it (e.g., because they require GNU Make).

  # The Linux build environment is a fully bootstrapped Nix

  # 1) Build glibc in the Nix build environment.  The result is
  #    pure.
  stdenvLinuxGlibc = stdenvNixPkgs.glibc;

  # 2) Construct a stdenv consisting of the Nix build environment, but
  #    with a gcc-wrapper that causes linking against the glibc from
  #    step 1.  However, since the gcc wrapper here *does* look in
  #    native system directories (e.g., `/usr/lib'), it doesn't
  #    prevent impurity in the things it builds (e.g., through
  #    `-lncurses').

  };

  # 3) Now we can build packages that will link against the Nix
  #    glibc.  We are on thin ice here: the compiler used to build
  #    these packages doesn't prevent impurity, so e.g. bash ends up
  #    linking against `/lib/libncurses.so', but the glibc from step 1
  #    *doesn't* search in `/lib' etc.  So these programs won't work.

  # 4) Therefore we build a new standard environment which is the same
  #    as the one in step 2, but with a gcc and binutils from step 3
  #    merged in.  Since these are pure (they don't search native
  #    system directories), things built by this stdenv should be pure.
  stdenvLinuxBoot2 = (import ../stdenv/nix-linux) {

    glibc = stdenvLinuxGlibc;
    inherit genericStdenv gccWrapper;
  };

  # 5) So these packages should be pure.
  stdenvLinuxBoot2Pkgs = allPackages {
    stdenv = stdenvLinuxBoot2;
    bootCurl = stdenvNativePkgs.curl;
  };

  # 6) Finally we can construct the Nix build environment from the
  #    packages from step 5.
  stdenvLinux = (import ../stdenv/nix-linux) {
    stdenv = stdenvLinuxBoot2;
    pkgs = stdenvLinuxBoot2Pkgs;
    glibc = stdenvLinuxGlibc;
    inherit genericStdenv gccWrapper;

  # 7) And we can build all packages against that, but we don't
  #    rebuild stuff from step 6.
  stdenvLinuxPkgs =
    allPackages {
      stdenv = stdenvLinux;
      bootCurl = stdenvLinuxBoot2Pkgs.curl;

      gnumake gnused gnutar gnugrep curl;
    } //
    {glibc = stdenvLinuxGlibc;};

  # In summary, we build gcc (and binutils) three times:
  #   - in stdenvLinuxBoot1 (from stdenvNativePkgs); impure
  #   - in stdenvLinuxBoot2 (from stdenvLinuxBoot1Pkgs); pure
  #   - in stdenvLinux (from stdenvLinuxBoot2Pkgs); pure
  # The last one may be redundant, but its good for validation (since
  # the second one may use impure inputs).  To reduce build time, we
  # could reduce the number of bootstrap stages inside each gcc build.
  # Right now there are 3 stages, so gcc is built 9 times!

  # On the other hand, a validating build of glibc is a good idea (it
  # probably won't work right now due to --rpath madness).


  # Darwin (Mac OS X) standard environment.  Very simple for now
  # (essentially it's just the native environment).
