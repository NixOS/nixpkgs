# This file defines the various standard build environments.
#
# On Linux systems, the standard build environment consists of
# Nix-built instances glibc and the `standard' Unix tools, i.e., the
# Posix utilities, the GNU C compiler, and so on.  On other systems,
# we use the native C library.

  # The native (i.e., impure) build environment.  This one uses the
  # tools installed on the system outside of the Nix environment,
  # i.e., the stuff in /bin, /usr/bin, etc.  This environment should
  # be used with care, since many Nix packages will not build properly
  # with it (e.g., because they require GNU Make).

  # The Linux build environment is a fully bootstrapped Nix
  # environment, that is, it should contain no external references.

  #    pure.

  stdenvLinuxBoot1Pkgs = allPackages {stdenv = stdenvLinuxBoot1;};

  # 4) However, since these packages are built by an native C compiler
  #    and linker, they may well pick up impure references (e.g., bash
  #    might end up linking against /lib/libncurses).  So repeat, but
  #    now use the Nix-built tools from step 2/3.
