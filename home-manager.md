Installed rycees home-manager in my user environment. 
After installing `$ man home-configuration.nix` shows config options, while `$ home-manager news` shows some
relevant or changed, available items. To edit the `home.nix` file kinda `configuration.nix` go to `/home/user/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix`.
