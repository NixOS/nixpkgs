[[https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs][Nixpkgs]] is a collection of over
40,000 software packages that can be installed with the
[[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]] package manager. It also implements
[[https://nixos.org/nixos/][NixOS]], a purely-functional Linux
distribution.

* Other Project Repositories

The sources of all offical Nix-related projects are in the
[[https://github.com/NixOS/][NixOS organization on GitHub]]. Here are
some of the main ones:

- [[https://github.com/NixOS/nix][Nix]] - the purely functional package
  manager

  deploy NixOS machines

* Continuous Integration and Distribution

Nixpkgs and NixOS are built and tested by our continuous integration
system, [[https://hydra.nixos.org/][Hydra]].

- [[https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixos/trunk-combined][Continuous
  package builds for unstable/master]]
- [[https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixos/release-19.09][Continuous
  package builds for the NixOS 19.09 release]]
- [[https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk-combined/tested#tabs-constituents][Tests
  for unstable/master]]
- [[https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/release-19.09/tested#tabs-constituents][Tests
  for the NixOS 19.09 release]]

Artifacts successfully built with Hydra are published to cache at
https://cache.nixos.org/. When successful build and test criteria are
met, the Nixpkgs expressions are distributed via
[[https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-channels][Nix channels]].

* Contributing

Nixpkgs is among the most active projects on GitHub. While thousands of
open issues and pull requests might seem a lot at first, it helps
consider it in the context of the scope of the project. Nixpkgs
describes how to build over 40,000 pieces of software and implements a
Linux distribution. The [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulse][GitHub
Insights]] page gives a sense of the project activity.

Community contributions are always welcome through GitHub Issues and
Pull Requests. When pull requests are made, our tooling automation bot,
[[https://github.com/NixOS/ofborg][OfBorg]] will perform various checks
to help ensure expression quality.

The /Nixpkgs maintainers/ are people who have assigned themselves to
maintain specific individual packages. We encourage people who care
about a package to assign themselves as a maintainer. When a pull
request is made against a package, OfBorg will notify the appropriate
maintainer(s). The /Nixpkgs committers/ are people who have been given
permission to merge.

Most contributions are based on and merged into these branches:

- =master= is the main branch where all small contributions go
- =staging= is branched from master, changes that have a big impact on
  Hydra builds go to this branch
- =staging-next= is branched from staging and only fixes to stabilize
  and security fixes with a big impact on Hydra builds should be
  contributed to this branch. This branch is merged into master when
  deemed of sufficiently high quality

[[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md][contributing
page]].

* Donations

The infrastructure for NixOS and related projects is maintained by a
nonprofit organization, the
[[https://nixos.org/nixos/foundation.html][NixOS Foundation]]. To ensure
the continuity and expansion of the NixOS infrastructure, we are looking
for donations to our organization.
