  /* `overrideDerivation drv f` takes a derivation (i.e., the result
     of a call to the builtin function `derivation`) and returns a new
     derivation in which the attributes of the original are overridden
     according to the function `f`.  The function `f` is called with
     the original derivation attributes.

     `overrideDerivation` allows certain "ad-hoc" customisation
     scenarios (e.g. in ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix).  For instance,
     if you want to "patch" the derivation returned by a package
     function in Nixpkgs to build another version than what the
     function itself provides.

     For another application, see build-support/vm, where this
     function is used to build arbitrary derivations inside a QEMU
     virtual machine.

     Note that in order to preserve evaluation errors, the new derivation's
     outPath depends on the old one's, which means that this function cannot
     be used in circular situations when the old derivation also depends on the
     new one.

     You should in general prefer `drv.overrideAttrs` over this function;
     see the nixpkgs manual for more information on overriding.

     Example:
       mySed = overrideDerivation pkgs.gnused (oldAttrs: {
         name = "sed-4.2.2-pre";
         src = fetchurl {
           url = ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/sed/sed-4.2.2-pre.tar.bz2;
           hash = "sha256-MxBJRcM2rYzQYwJ5XKxhXTQByvSg5jZc5cSHEZoB2IY=";
         };
         patches = [];
       });

    arguments automatically.  The function is called with the
