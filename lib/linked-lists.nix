/**
  Linked list operations.

  This library provides operations on linked lists of the form `{ head; tail; }`
  with `null` representing the empty list. These are useful for streaming operations
  and solving stack overflow issues with recursive algorithms that need to process
  large amounts of data.

  :::{.warning}
  These operations tend to be significantly slower than native lists,
  so they should only be used when necessary (e.g., to avoid stack overflow or
  for streaming use cases).
  :::

  A linked list is represented as either:
  - `null` for an empty list
  - `{ head; tail; }` where `head` is the first element and `tail` is the rest of the list

{ lib }:

# Algorithmic insights:
#
# We use two main strategies to avoid stack overflow:
#
# 1. Tiered Binary Reduce (for processing list elements):
#    - Process the list in exponentially growing chunks: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
#    - Build a binary tree traversal from leaves to root without knowing length upfront
#    - Stack depth: O(log n) where n is list length
#    - Used by: `tieredBinaryReduce`, `length`, `toList`
#
# 2. Divide and Conquer (for operations where the size of the work is a known quantity):
#    - Split the work in half recursively
#    - Stack depth: O(log n) where n is the parameter value
#    - Used by: `drop`
#
# Functions like `map` and `take` don't need these strategies because they produce
# output cells lazily: each output cell triggers evaluation of at most a bounded number
# of input cells (at most 1 for these functions). This keeps the stack bounded.
# Similarly, a function like `zip` would be fine as it evaluates one cell from each
# of two input lists (not stacked). Grouping consecutive elements is also safe as
# each output cell evaluates at most a small constant number of input cells before
# returning from the stack.
# Safely evaluating the full result is the responsibility of the consumer!

    Generic tiered binary reduce for linked lists.
