  # Compute the fixed point of the given function `f`, which is usually an
  # attribute set that expects its final, non-recursive representation as an

  #
  #     f = self: { foo = "foo"; bar = "bar"; foobar = self.foo + self.bar; }
  #
  # Nix evaluates this recursion until all references to `self` have been
  # resolved. At that point, the final result is returned and `f x = x` holds:
  #
  #     nix-repl> fix f
  #     { bar = "bar"; foo = "foo"; foobar = "foobar"; }
  #
  # See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator for further

  # for a concrete example.

  # honors `self`-references. This is accomplished with a function
  #
  #     g = self: super: { foo = super.foo + " + "; }
  #
  # that has access to the unmodified input (`super`) as well as the final
  # non-recursive representation of the attribute set (`self`). `extends`
  # differs from the native `//` operator insofar as that it's applied *before*
  # references to `self` are resolved:
  #
  #     nix-repl> fix (extends g f)
  #     { bar = "bar"; foo = "foo + "; foobar = "foo + bar"; }
  #
  # The name of the function is inspired by object-oriented inheritance, i.e.
  # think of it as an infix operator `g extends f` that mimics the syntax from
  # Java. It may seem counter-intuitive to have the "base class" as the second
  # argument, but it's nice this way if several uses of `extends` are cascaded.
