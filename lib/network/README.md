# Network library

This is the internal contributor documentation.

## Goals

The main goal of the network library is to provide utility functions for IPv4 and IPv6 conversions.
It should have the following properties.

- Easy: The functions should have obvious semantics.
- Safe: Throw early and helpful errors when mistakes are detected.
- Lazy: Only compute values when necessary.

## Design descisions

## Tests

Tests are declared in the `tests` directory.
