    Restrict a derivation to a predictable set of attribute names, so
    that the returned attrset is not strict in the actual derivation,
    saving a lot of computation when the derivation is non-trivial.

    This is useful in situations where a derivation might only be used for its
    passthru attributes, improving evaluation performance.

    The returned attribute set is lazy in `derivation`. Specifically, this
    means that the derivation will not be evaluated in at least the
    situations below.

    For illustration and/or testing, we define derivation such that its
    evaluation is very noticeable.

        let derivation = throw "This won't be evaluated.";

    In the following expressions, `derivation` will _not_ be evaluated:

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation; }).type

        attrNames (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation; })

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation; } // { foo = true; }).foo

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation; meta.foo = true; }).meta

    In these expressions, `derivation` _will_ be evaluated:

        "${lazyDerivation { inherit derivation }}"

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation }).outPath

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation }).meta

    And the following expressions are not valid, because the refer to
    implementation details and/or attributes that may not be present on
    some derivations:

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation }).buildInputs

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation }).passthru

        (lazyDerivation { inherit derivation }).pythonPath
