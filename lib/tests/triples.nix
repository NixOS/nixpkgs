# Run:
# [nixpkgs]$ nix-build -o expected-output lib/tests/triples.nix -A expected-output-from-gnu-config

# Expected output: [], or the failed cases

#
# This file tests our triple-parser, but it needs access to `pkgs`
# because `pkgs.gnu-config` is our source of truth for the
# correctness of parsing.  This file does not test `pkgs`; it tests
# `lib`.
#
# The tests below attempt to verify that parsing followed by
# unparsing behaves the same way as `gnu-config`, except in the
# rare and unusual cases where nixpkgs has carefully and
# deliberately decided to diverge from it.
#
# We use `gnu-config` as our source of ground truth not because it
# is elegant (it isn't) or sensible (it isn't), but because it:
#
# 1. has an executable (i.e. unambiguous) specification
# 2. covers a superset of the systems on which nixpkgs could be useful
# 3. is *not* under nixpkgs' control, to minimize bikeshedding/debate
# 4. emanates from an organization (GNU) which understands that
#    the taxonomy is not merely an implementation detail of one of
#    their software products, and has demonstrated this
#    understanding over an extended period of time (multiple
#    decades).
