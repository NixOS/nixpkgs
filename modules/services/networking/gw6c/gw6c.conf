##########################      READ ME!      ################################
#
# Welcome to the Gateway6 Client configuration file.
# In order to use the client, you need to modify the 'userid', 'passwd' and 
# 'server' parameters below depending on which of these situations applies:
# 
# 1. If you created a Freenet6 account, enter your userid and password below. 
#    Change the server name to "broker.freenet6.net" and auth_method to 'any'.
# 2. If you would like to use Freenet6 without creating an account, 
#    do not make any modifications and close this file. 
# 3. If this software was provided by your ISP, enter the userid, password and 
#    server name provided by your ISP below. 
#


########################## BASIC CONFIGURATION ################################

#
# User Identification and Password:
#   Specify your user name and password as provided by your ISP or Freenet6.
#   If you plan to connect anonymously, leave these values empty.
#   NOTE: Change auth_method option if you are using a username/password.
#
#   userid=<your_userid>
#   passwd=<your_password>
#
userid=@username@ 
passwd=@password@ 


#
# Gateway6 Server:
#   Specify a Gateway6 server name or IP address (provided by your ISP or 
#   Freenet6). An optional port number can be added; the default port number 
#   is 3653.
#  
#   Examples:
#     server=hostname # FQDN
#     server=A.B.C.D  # IPv4 address
#     server=[X:X::X:X] # IPv6 address
#     server=hostname:port_number  
#     server=A.B.C.D:port_number
#     server=[X:X::X:X]:port_number
#
#   Freenet6 account holders should enter broker.freenet6.net, otherwise use
#   anon.freenet6.net. Your ISP may provide you with a different server name. 
#
#server=anon.freenet6.net
#server=broker.freenet6.net
#server=broker.aarnet.net.au
server=@gw6server@

#
# Authentication Method:
#
#  auth_method=<{anonymous}|{any|passdss-3des-1|digest-md5|plain}>
#
#   anonymous:      Sends no username or password
#
#   any:            The most secure method will be used. 
#   passdss-3des-1: The password is sent encrypted.
#   digest-md5:     The password is sent encrypted.
#   plain:          Both username and password are sent as plain text.
#
# Recommended values:
#   - any:          If you are authenticating a username / password.
#   - anonymous:    If you are connecting anonymously.
#
#auth_method=anonymous
#auth_method=any
auth_method=@authMethod@


########################## ROUTING CONFIGURATION ##############################
# Use these parameters when you wish the client to act as a router and provide 
# IPv6 connectivity to IPv6-capable devices on your network.

#
# Local Host Type:
#   Change this value to 'router' to enable IPv6 advertisements.
#
#   host_type=<host|router>
#
host_type=host

#
# Prefix Length:
#   Length of the requested prefix. Valid values range between 0 and 64 when 
#   using V6*V4 tunnel modes, and between 0 and 32 when using V4V6 tunnel mode.
#
#   prefixlen=<integer>
#
prefixlen=64

#
# Advertisement Interface Prefix:
#   Name of the interface that will be configured to send router advertisements. 
#   This is an interface index on Windows (ex: 4) and a name on Linux
#   and BSD (ex: eth1 or fxp1). 
#
#   if_prefix=<interface name>
#
if_prefix=

#
# DNS Server: 
#   A DNS server list to which the reverse prefix will be delegated. Servers
#   are separated by the colon(:) delimiter.

#
dns_server=

# 
template=linux

#
# Proxy client:

#   such as a Cisco router. 
#
#   proxy_client=<yes|no>
#
#   NOTE: NAT traversal is not possible in proxy mode. 
#
proxy_client=no


############################ BROKER REDIRECTION ###############################

#
# Broker List File Name:
#   The 'broker_list' directive specifies the filename where the broker
#   list received during broker redirection will be saved. 
#
#   broker_list=<file_name>
#  
broker_list=/tmp/tsp-broker-list.txt

#
# Last Server Used File Name:
#   The 'last_server' directive specifies the filename where the address of
#   the last broker to which a connection was successfully established will 
#   be saved.
#
#   last_server=<file_name>
#
last_server=/tmp/tsp-last-server.txt

#
# Always Use Last Known Working Server:
#   The value of the 'always_use_same_server' directive determines whether the 
#   client should always try to connect to the broker found in the 
#   'last_server' directive filename. 
#
#   always_use_same_server=<yes|no>
#
always_use_same_server=no


#################################### LOGGING ##################################

#
# Log Verbosity Configuration:
#   The format is 'log_<destination>=level', where possible values for 
#   'destination' are:
#
#   - console  (logging to the console [AKA stdout])
#   - stderr   (logging to standard error)
#   - file     (logging to a file)
#   - syslog   (logging to syslog [Unix only])
#
#   and 'level' is a digit between 0 and 3. A 'level' value of 0 disables 
#   logging to the destination, while values 1 to 3 request increasing levels 
#   of log verbosity and detail. If 'level' is not specified, a value of 1 is 
#   assumed.
#
#   Example:
#     log_file=3   (Maximal logging to a file)
#     log_stderr=0 (Logging to standard error disabled)
#     log_console= (Minimal logging to the console) 
#
#   - Default configuration on Windows platforms:
#
#     log_console=0
#     log_stderr=0
#     log_file=1
#
#   - Default configuration on Unix platforms:
#
#     log_console=0
#     log_stderr=1
#     log_file=0
#     log_syslog=0
#
#log_console=
#log_stderr=
#log_file=
#log_syslog=
log_file=3

#
# Log File Name:
#   When logging to file is requested using the 'log_file' directive, the name
#   and path of the file to use may be specified using this directive.
#
#   log_filename=<file_name>
#
log_filename=/var/log/gw6c.log

#
# Log File Rotation:
#   When logging to file is requested using the 'log_file' directive, log file 
#   rotation may be enabled. When enabled, the contents of the log file will 
#   be moved to a backup file just before it reaches the maximum log file size 
#   specified via this directive.
#
#   The name of the backup file is the name of the original log file with 
#   '.<timestamp>' inserted before the file extension. If the file does not 
#   have an extension, '.<timestamp>' is appended to the name of the original
#   log file. The timestamp specifies when the rotation occurred.
#
#   After the contents of the log file have been moved to the backup file, the 
#   original file is cleared, and logging resumes at the beginning of the file. 
#
#   log_rotation=<yes|no>
#
log_rotation=no

#
# Log File Rotation Size:
#   The 'log_rotation_size' directive specifies the maximum size a log file may 
#   reach before rotation occurs, if enabled. The value is expressed in 
#   kilobytes.
#
#   log_rotation_size=<16|32|128|1024>
#
log_rotation_size=32

#
# Syslog Logging Facility [Unix Only]:
#   When logging to syslog is requested using the 'log_syslog' directive, the 
#   facility to use may be specified using this directive.
#
#   syslog_facility=<USER|LOCAL[0-7]>
#
syslog_facility=USER
