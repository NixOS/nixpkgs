* Interactive shell helpers

Some packages provide the shell integration to be more useful. But
unlike other systems, nix doesn't have a standard share directory
location. This is why a bunch =PACKAGE-share= scripts are shipped that
print the location of the corresponding shared folder. Current list of
such packages is as following:

- =autojump=: =autojump-share=

- =fzf=: =fzf-share=

E.g. =autojump= can then used in the .bashrc like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    source "$(autojump-share)/autojump.bash"
#+END_EXAMPLE
