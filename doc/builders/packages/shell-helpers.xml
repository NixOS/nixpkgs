  Some packages provide the shell integration to be more useful. But unlike other systems, nix doesn't have a standard share directory location. This is why a bunch <command>PACKAGE-share</command> scripts are shipped that print the location of the corresponding shared folder. Current list of such packages is as following:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <literal>fzf</literal>: <command>fzf-share</command>
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  E.g. <literal>fzf</literal> can then used in the .bashrc like this:
<screen>
  source "$(fzf-share)/completion.bash"
  source "$(fzf-share)/key-bindings.bash"
</screen>
 </para>
