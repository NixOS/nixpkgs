  The <link xlink:href="https://www.citrix.com/products/workspace-app/">Citrix Workspace App</link> is a remote desktop viewer which provides access to <link xlink:href="https://www.citrix.com/products/xenapp-xendesktop/">XenDesktop</link> installations.

  <title>Basic usage</title>

  <para>
   The tarball archive needs to be downloaded manually as the license agreements of the vendor for <link xlink:href="https://www.citrix.de/downloads/workspace-app/linux/workspace-app-for-linux-latest.html">Citrix Workspace</link> needs to be accepted first. Then run <command>nix-prefetch-url file://$PWD/linuxx64-$version.tar.gz</command>. With the archive available in the store the package can be built and installed with Nix.

  <title>Citrix Selfservice</title>
  <para>
   The <link xlink:href="https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX200337">selfservice</link> is an application managing Citrix desktops and applications. Please note that this feature only works with at least <package>citrix_workspace_20_06_0</package> and later versions.
  </para>
  <para>
   In order to set this up, you first have to <link xlink:href="https://its.uiowa.edu/support/article/102186">download the <literal>.cr</literal> file from the Netscaler Gateway</link>. After that you can configure the <command>selfservice</command> like this:

<prompt>$ </prompt>storebrowse -C ~/Downloads/receiverconfig.cr

  <title>Custom certificates</title>

  <para>
   The <literal>Citrix Workspace App</literal> in <literal>nixpkgs</literal> trusts several certificates <link xlink:href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html">from the Mozilla database</link> by default. However several companies using Citrix might require their own corporate certificate. On distros with imperative packaging these certs can be stored easily in <link xlink:href="https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/receiver-for-linux-command-reference/en/13.7/"><literal>$ICAROOT</literal></link>, however this directory is a store path in <literal>nixpkgs</literal>. In order to work around this issue the package provides a simple mechanism to add custom certificates without rebuilding the entire package using <literal>symlinkJoin</literal>:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[with import <nixpkgs> { config.allowUnfree = true; };
let extraCerts = [ ./custom-cert-1.pem ./custom-cert-2.pem /* ... */ ]; in
citrix_workspace.override {
  inherit extraCerts;
}]]>
