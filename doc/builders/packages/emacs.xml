   <title>Configuring Emacs</title>

   <para>
    The Emacs package comes with some extra helpers to make it easier to configure. <varname>emacsWithPackages</varname> allows you to manage packages from ELPA. This means that you will not have to install that packages from within Emacs. For instance, if you wanted to use <literal>company</literal>, <literal>counsel</literal>, <literal>flycheck</literal>, <literal>ivy</literal>, <literal>magit</literal>, <literal>projectile</literal>, and <literal>use-package</literal> you could use this as a <filename>~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix</filename> override:
   </para>

<screen>
{
  packageOverrides = pkgs: with pkgs; {
    myEmacs = emacsWithPackages (epkgs: (with epkgs.melpaStablePackages; [
      company
      counsel
      flycheck
      ivy
      magit
      projectile
      use-package
    ]));
  }
}
</screen>

   <para>
    You can install it like any other packages via <command>nix-env -iA myEmacs</command>. However, this will only install those packages. It will not <literal>configure</literal> them for us. To do this, we need to provide a configuration file. Luckily, it is possible to do this from within Nix! By modifying the above example, we can make Emacs load a custom config file. The key is to create a package that provide a <filename>default.el</filename> file in <filename>/share/emacs/site-start/</filename>. Emacs knows to load this file automatically when it starts.

    This provides a fairly full Emacs start file. It will load in addition to the user's presonal config. You can always disable it by passing <command>-q</command> to the Emacs command.

   <para>
    Sometimes <varname>emacsWithPackages</varname> is not enough, as this package set has some priorities imposed on packages (with the lowest priority assigned to Melpa Unstable, and the highest for packages manually defined in <filename>pkgs/top-level/emacs-packages.nix</filename>). But you can't control this priorities when some package is installed as a dependency. You can override it on per-package-basis, providing all the required dependencies manually - but it's tedious and there is always a possibility that an unwanted dependency will sneak in through some other package. To completely override such a package you can use <varname>overrideScope'</varname>.
