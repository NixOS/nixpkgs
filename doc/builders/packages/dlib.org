[[http://dlib.net/][DLib]] is a modern, C++-based toolkit which provides
several machine learning algorithms.

** Compiling without AVX support

Especially older CPUs don't support
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions][AVX]]
(Advanced Vector Extensions) instructions that are used by DLib to
optimize their algorithms.

On the affected hardware errors like =Illegal instruction= will occur.
In those cases AVX support needs to be disabled:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  self: super: {
    dlib = super.dlib.override { avxSupport = false; };
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE
