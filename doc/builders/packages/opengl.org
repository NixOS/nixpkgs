Packages that use OpenGL have NixOS desktop as their primary target. The
current solution for loading the GPU-specific drivers is based on
=libglvnd= and looks for the driver implementation in =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
If you are using a non-NixOS GNU/Linux/X11 desktop with free software
video drivers, consider launching OpenGL-dependent programs from Nixpkgs
with Nixpkgs versions of =libglvnd= and =mesa_drivers= in
=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. For proprietary video drivers you might have luck
with also adding the corresponding video driver package.
