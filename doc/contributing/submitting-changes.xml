       <para>
        You can make branch from a commit of your local <command>nixos-version</command>. That will help you to avoid additional local compilations. Because you will receive packages from binary cache.

           For example: <command>nixos-version</command> returns <command>15.05.git.0998212 (Dingo)</command>. So you can do:

 <section xml:id="submitting-changes-submitting-security-fixes">
  <title>Submitting security fixes</title>

  <para>
   Security fixes are submitted in the same way as other changes and thus the same guidelines apply.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the security fix comes in the form of a patch and a CVE is available, then the name of the patch should be the CVE identifier, so e.g. <literal>CVE-2019-13636.patch</literal> in the case of a patch that is included in the Nixpkgs tree. If a patch is fetched the name needs to be set as well, e.g.:
  </para>

<programlisting>
   (fetchpatch {
     name = "CVE-2019-11068.patch";
     url = "https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/commit/e03553605b45c88f0b4b2980adfbbb8f6fca2fd6.patch";
     sha256 = "0pkpb4837km15zgg6h57bncp66d5lwrlvkr73h0lanywq7zrwhj8";
   })
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   If a security fix applies to both master and a stable release then, similar to regular changes, they are preferably delivered via master first and cherry-picked to the release branch.
  </para>

  <para>
   Critical security fixes may by-pass the staging branches and be delivered directly to release branches such as <literal>master</literal> and <literal>release-*</literal>.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="submitting-changes-pull-request-template">
  <title>Pull Request Template</title>

  <para>
   The pull request template helps determine what steps have been made for a contribution so far, and will help guide maintainers on the status of a change. The motivation section of the PR should include any extra details the title does not address and link any existing issues related to the pull request.
  </para>

  <para>
   When a PR is created, it will be pre-populated with some checkboxes detailed below:
  </para>

  <section xml:id="submitting-changes-tested-with-sandbox">
   <title>Tested using sandboxing</title>

   <para>
    When sandbox builds are enabled, Nix will setup an isolated environment for each build process. It is used to remove further hidden dependencies set by the build environment to improve reproducibility. This includes access to the network during the build outside of <function>fetch*</function> functions and files outside the Nix store. Depending on the operating system access to other resources are blocked as well (ex. inter process communication is isolated on Linux); see <link
      xlink:href="https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#conf-sandbox">sandbox</link> in Nix manual for details.
   </para>

   <para>
    Sandboxing is not enabled by default in Nix due to a small performance hit on each build. In pull requests for <link
        xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/">nixpkgs</link> people are asked to test builds with sandboxing enabled (see <literal>Tested using sandboxing</literal> in the pull request template) because in<link
        xlink:href="https://nixos.org/hydra/">https://nixos.org/hydra/</link> sandboxing is also used.
   </para>

   <para>
    Depending if you use NixOS or other platforms you can use one of the following methods to enable sandboxing <emphasis role="bold">before</emphasis> building the package:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis role="bold">Globally enable sandboxing on NixOS</emphasis>: add the following to <filename>configuration.nix</filename>

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="submitting-changes-platform-diversity">
   <title>Built on platform(s)</title>

   <para>
    Many Nix packages are designed to run on multiple platforms. As such, it's important to let the maintainer know which platforms your changes have been tested on. It's not always practical to test a change on all platforms, and is not required for a pull request to be merged. Only check the systems you tested the build on in this section.
   </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="submitting-changes-nixos-tests">
   <title>Tested via one or more NixOS test(s) if existing and applicable for the change (look inside nixos/tests)</title>

   <para>
    Packages with automated tests are much more likely to be merged in a timely fashion because it doesn't require as much manual testing by the maintainer to verify the functionality of the package. If there are existing tests for the package, they should be run to verify your changes do not break the tests. Tests only apply to packages with NixOS modules defined and can only be run on Linux. For more details on writing and running tests, see the <link
        xlink:href="https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-nixos-tests">section in the NixOS manual</link>.

  </section>

  <section xml:id="submitting-changes-tested-compilation">
   <title>Tested compilation of all pkgs that depend on this change using <command>nixpkgs-review</command></title>

   <para>
    If you are updating a package's version, you can use nixpkgs-review to make sure all packages that depend on the updated package still compile correctly. The <command>nixpkgs-review</command> utility can look for and build all dependencies either based on uncommited changes with the <literal>wip</literal> option or specifying a github pull request number.
   </para>

  <section xml:id="submitting-changes-tested-execution">
   <title>Tested execution of all binary files (usually in <filename>./result/bin/</filename>)</title>

   <para>
    It's important to test any executables generated by a build when you change or create a package in nixpkgs. This can be done by looking in <filename>./result/bin</filename> and running any files in there, or at a minimum, the main executable for the package. For example, if you make a change to <package>texlive</package>, you probably would only check the binaries associated with the change you made rather than testing all of them.

The contributing document has detailed information on standards the Nix community has for commit messages, reviews, licensing of contributions you make to the project, etc... Everyone should read and understand the standards the community has for contributing before submitting a pull request.
