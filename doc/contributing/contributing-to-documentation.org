The DocBook sources of the Nixpkgs manual are in the =doc= subdirectory
of the Nixpkgs repository.

You can quickly check your edits with =make=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ cd /path/to/nixpkgs/doc
  $ nix-shell
  [nix-shell]$ make
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you experience problems, run =make debug= to help understand the
docbook errors.

After making modifications to the manual, it's important to build it
before committing. You can do that as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ cd /path/to/nixpkgs/doc
  $ nix-shell
  [nix-shell]$ make clean
  [nix-shell]$ nix-build .
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the build succeeds, the manual will be in
=./result/share/doc/nixpkgs/manual.html=.
