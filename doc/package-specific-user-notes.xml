 <title>Package-specific usage notes</title>
 <para>
         These chapters includes some notes
         that apply to specific packages and should
         answer some of the frequently asked questions
         related to Nixpkgs use.

  Some useful information related to package use 
  can be found in <link linkend="chap-package-notes">package-specific development notes</link>.

 <section xml:id="opengl">
  <title>OpenGL</title>

  <para>
   Packages that use OpenGL have NixOS desktop as their primary target. The
   current solution for loading the GPU-specific drivers is based on
   <literal>libglvnd</literal> and looks for the driver implementation in
   <literal>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</literal>. If you are using a non-NixOS
   GNU/Linux/X11 desktop with free software video drivers, consider launching
   OpenGL-dependent programs from Nixpkgs with Nixpkgs versions of
   <literal>libglvnd</literal> and <literal>mesa_drivers</literal> in
   <literal>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</literal>. For proprietary video drivers you might
   have luck with also adding the corresponding video driver package.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="locales">
  <title>Locales</title>

  <para>
   To allow simultaneous use of packages linked against different versions of
   <literal>glibc</literal> with different locale archive formats Nixpkgs
   patches <literal>glibc</literal> to rely on
   <literal>LOCALE_ARCHIVE</literal> environment variable.
  </para>

  <para>
   On non-NixOS distributions this variable is obviously not set. This can
   cause regressions in language support or even crashes in some
   Nixpkgs-provided programs. The simplest way to mitigate this problem is
   exporting the <literal>LOCALE_ARCHIVE</literal> variable pointing to
   <literal>${glibcLocales}/lib/locale/locale-archive</literal>. The drawback
   (and the reason this is not the default) is the relatively large (a hundred
   MiB) size of the full set of locales. It is possible to build a custom set
   of locales by overriding parameters <literal>allLocales</literal> and
   <literal>locales</literal> of the package.

  <title>Emacs</title>

  <section xml:id="sec-emacs-config">
   <title>Configuring Emacs</title>

   <para>
    The Emacs package comes with some extra helpers to make it easier to
    configure. <varname>emacsWithPackages</varname> allows you to manage
    packages from ELPA. This means that you will not have to install that
    packages from within Emacs. For instance, if you wanted to use
    <literal>company</literal>, <literal>counsel</literal>,
    <literal>flycheck</literal>, <literal>ivy</literal>,
    <literal>magit</literal>, <literal>projectile</literal>, and
    <literal>use-package</literal> you could use this as a
    <filename>~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix</filename> override:
   </para>

<screen>
{
  packageOverrides = pkgs: with pkgs; {
    myEmacs = emacsWithPackages (epkgs: (with epkgs.melpaStablePackages; [
      company
      counsel
      flycheck
      ivy
      magit
      projectile
      use-package
    ]));
  }
}
</screen>

   <para>
    You can install it like any other packages via <command>nix-env -iA
    myEmacs</command>. However, this will only install those packages. It will
    not <literal>configure</literal> them for us. To do this, we need to
    provide a configuration file. Luckily, it is possible to do this from
    within Nix! By modifying the above example, we can make Emacs load a custom
    config file. The key is to create a package that provide a
    <filename>default.el</filename> file in
    <filename>/share/emacs/site-start/</filename>. Emacs knows to load this
    file automatically when it starts.
   </para>

    This provides a fairly full Emacs start file. It will load in addition to
    the user's presonal config. You can always disable it by passing
    <command>-q</command> to the Emacs command.
   </para>

   <para>
    Sometimes <varname>emacsWithPackages</varname> is not enough, as this
    package set has some priorities imposed on packages (with the lowest
    priority assigned to Melpa Unstable, and the highest for packages manually
    defined in <filename>pkgs/top-level/emacs-packages.nix</filename>). But you
    can't control this priorities when some package is installed as a
    dependency. You can override it on per-package-basis, providing all the
    required dependencies manually - but it's tedious and there is always a
    possibility that an unwanted dependency will sneak in through some other
    package. To completely override such a package you can use
    <varname>overrideScope'</varname>.
   </para>

<screen>
overrides = self: super: rec {
  haskell-mode = self.melpaPackages.haskell-mode;

 <section xml:id="unfree-software">
  <title>Unfree software</title>

  <para>
   All users of Nixpkgs are free software users, and many users (and
   developers) of Nixpkgs want to limit and tightly control their exposure to
   unfree software. At the same time, many users need (or want)
   to run some specific
   pieces of proprietary software. Nixpkgs includes some expressions for unfree
   software packages. By default unfree software cannot be installed and
   doesn’t show up in searches. To allow installing unfree software in a
   single Nix invocation one can export
   <literal>NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1</literal>. For a persistent solution, users
   can set <literal>allowUnfree</literal> in the Nixpkgs configuration.
  </para>

  <para>
   Fine-grained control is possible by defining
   <literal>allowUnfreePredicate</literal> function in config; it takes the
   <literal>mkDerivation</literal> parameter attrset and returns
   <literal>true</literal> for unfree packages that should be allowed.
  </para>

   <title>Steam in Nix</title>

   <para>
    Steam is distributed as a <filename>.deb</filename> file, for now only as
    an i686 package (the amd64 package only has documentation). When unpacked,
    it has a script called <filename>steam</filename> that in Ubuntu (their
    target distro) would go to <filename>/usr/bin </filename>. When run for the
    first time, this script copies some files to the user's home, which include
    another script that is the ultimate responsible for launching the steam
    binary, which is also in $HOME.

    The current approach to deploy Steam in NixOS is composing a FHS-compatible
    chroot environment, as documented
    <link xlink:href="http://sandervanderburg.blogspot.nl/2013/09/composing-fhs-compatible-chroot.html">here</link>.
    This allows us to have binaries in the expected paths without disrupting
    the system, and to avoid patching them to work in a non FHS environment.

    For 64-bit systems it's important to have

<programlisting>hardware.pulseaudio.support32Bit = true;</programlisting>
    if you are using PulseAudio - this will enable 32bit ALSA apps integration.
    To use the Steam controller or other Steam supported controllers such as

    The <literal>Citrix Receiver</literal> and <literal>Citrix Workspace App</literal>

    <link xlink:href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html">from the

    might require their own corporate certificate. On distros with imperative
