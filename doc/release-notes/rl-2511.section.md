# Nixpkgs 25.11 ("Xantusia", 2025.11/??) {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11}

## Highlights {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-highlights}
<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The initial work to support native compilation on LoongArch64 has completed, with further changes currently
  in preparation. In accordance with the [Software Development and Build Convention for LoongArch Architectures](https://github.com/loongson/la-softdev-convention),
  this release sets the default march level to `la64v1.0`, covering the desktop and server processors of 3X5000
  and newer series. However, embedded chips without LSX (Loongson SIMD eXtension), such as 2K0300 SoC, are not
  supported. `pkgsCross.loongarch64-linux-embedded` can be used to build software and systems for these platforms.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-incompatibilities}
