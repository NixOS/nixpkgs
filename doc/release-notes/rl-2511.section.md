# Nixpkgs 25.11 ("Xantusia", 2025.11/??) {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11}

## Highlights {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-highlights}
<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The initial work to support native compilation on LoongArch64 has completed, with further changes currently
  in preparation. In accordance with the [Software Development and Build Convention for LoongArch Architectures](https://github.com/loongson/la-softdev-convention),
  this release sets the default march level to `la64v1.0`, covering the desktop and server processors of 3X5000
  and newer series. However, embedded chips without LSX (Loongson SIMD eXtension), such as 2K0300 SoC, are not
  supported. `pkgsCross.loongarch64-linux-embedded` can be used to build software and systems for these platforms.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The `offrss` package was removed due to lack of upstream maintenance since 2012. It's recommended for users to migrate to another RSS reader

- `base16-builder` node package has been removed due to lack of upstream maintenance.
- `gentium` package now provides `Gentium-*.ttf` files, and not `GentiumPlus-*.ttf` files like before. The font identifiers `Gentium Plus*` are available in the `gentium-plus` package, and if you want to use the more recently updated package `gentium` [by sil](https://software.sil.org/gentium/), you should update your configuration files to use the `Gentium` font identifier.
- `space-orbit` package has been removed due to lack of upstream maintenance. Debian upstream stopped tracking it in 2011.

- `gnome-keyring` no longer ships with an SSH agent anymore because it has been deprecated upstream. You should use `gcr_4` instead, which provides the same features. More information on why this was done can be found on [the relevant GCR upstream PR](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gcr/-/merge_requests/67).

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Added `rewriteURL` attribute to the nixpkgs `config`, to allow for rewriting the URLs downloaded by `fetchurl`.

- New hardening flags, `strictflexarrays1` and `strictflexarrays3` were made available, corresponding to the gcc/clang options `-fstrict-flex-arrays=1` and `-fstrict-flex-arrays=3` respectively.

- `gramps` has been updated to 6.0.0
  Upstream recommends [backing up your Family Trees](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_6.0_Wiki_Manual_-_Manage_Family_Trees#Backing_up_a_Family_Tree) before upgrading.

- `meta.mainProgram`: Changing this `meta` entry can lead to a package rebuild due to being used to determine the `NIX_MAIN_PROGRAM` environment variable.

- `pytestCheckHook` now invokes the `pytest` command directly instead of using `python3 -m pytest`, preventing the current working directory of the `pytestCheckPhase` (usually the build directory) from becoming the first directory to search for modules.
  The installed site packages directory now becomes the first directory to search for modules, and Python packages that need to test against the built and installed package no longer need to `cd` to another directory before testing.

  In addition, `pytestCheckHook` now adds the source module into `disabledTestPaths` if they are right under the current working directory, preventing import mismatch when using the installed modules for testing.
  Python packages no longer need to delete the source modules before running `pytest`.

- `versionCheckHook`: Packages that previously relied solely on `pname` to locate the program used to version check, but have a differing `meta.mainProgram` entry, might now fail.
