# Nixpkgs 25.11 ("Xantusia", 2025.11/??) {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11}

## Highlights {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-highlights}
<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The initial work to support native compilation on LoongArch64 has completed, with further changes currently
  in preparation. In accordance with the [Software Development and Build Convention for LoongArch Architectures](https://github.com/loongson/la-softdev-convention),
  this release sets the default march level to `la64v1.0`, covering the desktop and server processors of 3X5000
  and newer series. However, embedded chips without LSX (Loongson SIMD eXtension), such as 2K0300 SoC, are not
  supported. `pkgsCross.loongarch64-linux-embedded` can be used to build software and systems for these platforms.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- The `offrss` package was removed due to lack of upstream maintenance since 2012. It's recommended for users to migrate to another RSS reader

- `base16-builder` node package has been removed due to lack of upstream maintenance.
- `gentium` package now provides `Gentium-*.ttf` files, and not `GentiumPlus-*.ttf` files like before. The font identifiers `Gentium Plus*` are available in the `gentium-plus` package, and if you want to use the more recently updated package `gentium` [by sil](https://software.sil.org/gentium/), you should update your configuration files to use the `Gentium` font identifier.
- `space-orbit` package has been removed due to lack of upstream maintenance. Debian upstream stopped tracking it in 2011.
- `command-not-found` package is now disabled by default; it works only for nix-channels based systems, and requires setup for it to work.

- `gnome-keyring` no longer ships with an SSH agent anymore because it has been deprecated upstream. You should use `gcr_4` instead, which provides the same features. More information on why this was done can be found on [the relevant GCR upstream PR](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gcr/-/merge_requests/67).

- `lima` package now only includes the guest agent for the host's architecture by default. If your guest VM's architecture differs from your Lima host's, you'll need to enable the `lima-additional-guestagents` package by setting `withAdditionalGuestAgents = true` when overriding lima with this input.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- Added `rewriteURL` attribute to the nixpkgs `config`, to allow for rewriting the URLs downloaded by `fetchurl`.

- New hardening flags, `strictflexarrays1` and `strictflexarrays3` were made available, corresponding to the gcc/clang options `-fstrict-flex-arrays=1` and `-fstrict-flex-arrays=3` respectively.

- `gramps` has been updated to 6.0.0
  Upstream recommends [backing up your Family Trees](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_6.0_Wiki_Manual_-_Manage_Family_Trees#Backing_up_a_Family_Tree) before upgrading.
