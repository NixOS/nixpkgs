# Nixpkgs 25.05 (2025.05/??) {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05}

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `services.rippled` has been removed, as `rippled` was broken and had not been updated since 2022.

- `services.rippleDataApi` has been removed, as `ripple-data-api` was broken and had not been updated since 2022.

- The [`no-broken-symlinks` hook](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#no-broken-symlinks.sh) was added to catch builds containing dangling or reflexive symlinks, as these are indicative of problems with packaging.
  The hook can be disabled by providing `dontCheckForBrokenSymlinks = true;` as an argument to `mkDerivation`.
  For more information, [check the docs](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#no-broken-symlinks.sh) or [see this PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/370750).

- The `nixLog*` family of functions made available through the standard environment have been rewritten to prefix messages with both the debug level and the function name of the caller.
  The `nixLog` function, which logs unconditionally, was also re-introduced and modified to prefix messages with the function name of the caller.
  For more information, [see this PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/370742).

- The `rustPlatform.fetchCargoTarball` function is deprecated, because it relied on `cargo vendor` not changing its output format to keep fixed-output derivation hashes the same, which is a Nix invariant, and Cargo 1.84.0 changed `cargo vendor`'s output format.
  It should generally be replaced with `rustPlatform.fetchCargoVendor`, but `rustPlatform.importCargoLock` may also be appropriate in some circumstances.
  `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` users must set `useFetchCargoVendor` to `true` and regenerate the `cargoHash`.

- Default ICU version updated from 74 to 76

### Titanium removed {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-incompatibilities-titanium-removed}

- `titaniumenv`, `titanium`, and `titanium-alloy` have been removed due to lack of maintenance in Nixpkgs.

### NexusMods.App upgraded {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-incompatibilities-nexusmods-app-upgraded}

- `nexusmods-app` has been upgraded from version 0.6.3 to 0.7.3.

  - Before upgrading, you **must reset all app state** (mods, games, settings, etc). NexusMods.App will crash if any state from a version older than 0.7.0 is still present.

  - Typically, you can can reset to a clean state by running `NexusMods.App uninstall-app`. See Nexus Mod's [how to uninstall the app](https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/Uninstall) documentation for more detail and alternative methods.

  - This should not be necessary going forward, because loading app state from 0.7.0 or newer is now supported. This is documented in the [0.7.1 changelog](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.7.1).

## Nixpkgs Library {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-lib}

### Breaking changes {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-lib-breaking}

- Structure of the `functor` of some types has changed. `functor` is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon. If you did rely on it let us know in this [PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/363565).
  - [`lib.types.enum`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-option-types-basic): Previously the `functor.payload` was the list of enum values directly. Now it is an attribute set containing the values in the `values` attribute.
  - [`lib.types.separatedString`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-option-types-string): Previously the `functor.payload` was the separator directly. Now it is an attribute set containing the separator in the `sep` attribute.

- The `tinycc` package now has the `dev`, `doc` and `lib` outputs, thus,
`tinycc.out` may now only provide the tcc and cross compilers binaries.

- The `virtualisation.hypervGuest.videoMode` option has been removed. Standard tooling can now be used to configure display modes for Hyper-V VMs.

### Deprecations {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-lib-deprecations}

- `functor` is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon, but since its status wasn't clear and it has had some use cases without alternatives, changes are being handled as gracefully as possible. Deprecations within functor:
  - `functor.wrapped` is now deprecated for some types and using it will give a warning with migration instructions. It is deprecated for these types:
    - `lib.types.attrsWith`
    - `lib.types.listOf`

- Plasma 5 and Qt 5 based versions of associated software are deprecated in NixOS 25.05, and will be removed in NixOS 25.11. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Plasma 6.

- `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` stops handling the deprecated argument `cargoSha256`. Out-of-tree packages that haven't migrated from `cargoSha256` to `cargoHash` now receive errors.
