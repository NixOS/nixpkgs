# Nixpkgs 25.05 (2025.05/??) {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05}

## Highlights {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-highlights}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- **This release of Nixpkgs requires macOS Big Sur 11.3 or newer, as announced in the 24.11 release notes.**
  We cannot guarantee that packages will continue to work on older versions of macOS.
  Future Nixpkgs releases will only support [macOS versions supported by Apple](https://endoflife.date/macos); this means that **Nixpkgs 25.11 will require macOS Sonoma 14 or newer**.
  Users on old macOS versions should consider upgrading to a supported version (potentially using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) for old hardware) or installing NixOS.
  If neither of those options are viable and you require new versions of software, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) supports versions back to Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.

- The default kernel package has been updated from 6.6 to 6.12. All supported kernels remain available.

- GCC has been updated from GCC 13 to GCC 14.
  This introduces some backwards‐incompatible changes; see the [upstream porting guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html) for details.

- LLVM has been updated from LLVM 16 (on Darwin) and LLVM 18 (on other platforms) to LLVM 19.
  This introduces some backwards‐incompatible changes; see the [upstream release notes](https://releases.llvm.org/) for details.

- Emacs has been updated to 30.1.
  This introduces some backwards‐incompatible changes; see the NEWS for details.
  NEWS can been viewed from Emacs by typing `C-h n`, or by clicking `Help->Emacs News` from the menu bar.
  It can also be browsed [online](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS?h=emacs-30).

- The default PHP version has been updated to 8.4.

- The default Erlang OTP version has been updated to 27.

- The default Elixir version has been updated to 1.18.

- `buildPythonPackage`, `buildPythonApplication` and the Python building setup hooks now support both `__structuredAttrs = true` and `__structuredAttrs = false`.

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `apptainer` and `singularity` deprecate the workaround of overriding `vendorHash` and related attributes via `<pkg>.override`,
  in favour of the unified overriding of the same group of attributes via `<pkg>.overrideAttrs`.
  The compatibility layer will be removed in future releases.

- `squid` has been updated to version 7, this release includes multiple breaking changes, like ESI removal.
  For more information, [check the release notes](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/releases/tag/SQUID_7_0_1).

- The [`no-broken-symlinks` hook](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#no-broken-symlinks.sh) was added to catch builds containing dangling or reflexive symlinks, as these are indicative of problems with packaging.
  The hook can be disabled by providing `dontCheckForBrokenSymlinks = true;` as an argument to `mkDerivation`.
  For more information, [check the docs](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#no-broken-symlinks.sh) or [see this PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/370750).

- The hand written `perlPackages.SearchXapian` bindings have been dropped in favor of the (mostly compatible)
  `perlPackages.Xapian`.

- [testers.shellcheck](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#tester-shellcheck) now warns when `name` is not provided.
  The `name` argument will become mandatory in a future release.

- `xdragon` package has been renamed to `dragon-drop`.
  `xdragon` is an alias to `dragon-drop` and the package still provides `bin/xdragon`.
  `bin/dragon` is no longer supplied.

- The `nixLog*` family of functions made available through the standard environment have been rewritten to prefix messages with both the debug level and the function name of the caller.
  The `nixLog` function, which logs unconditionally, was also re-introduced and modified to prefix messages with the function name of the caller.
  For more information, [see this PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/370742).

- Rust packages will need to regenerate their `cargoHash`.
  Cargo 1.84.0 changed the format of `cargo vendor` output, which invalidated all existing `rustPlatform.fetchCargoTarball` hashes.
  To preserve Nix’s invariants, it has been replaced with `rustPlatform.fetchCargoVendor`, an independent implementation prioritizing format stability.
  `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` now uses `rustPlatform.fetchCargoVendor` by default; a hash mismatch error is expected in third‐party Rust packages when updating to Nixpkgs 25.05.
  Packages wishing to maintain compatibility with Nixpkgs 24.11 must set `useFetchCargoVendor` to `true` explicitly.
  `rustPlatform.importCargoLock` may also be appropriate in some circumstances.

- NetBox was updated to `>= 4.2.0`. Have a look at the breaking changes
  of the [4.1 release](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v4.1.0)
  and the [4.2 release](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v4.2.0),
  make the required changes to your database, if needed, then upgrade by setting `services.netbox.package = pkgs.netbox_4_2;` in your configuration.

- NetBox version 4.0.X available as `netbox_4_0` was removed. Please upgrade to `4.2`.

- `golangci-lint` has reached `v2`. Please read the changes and view the migration guide [here](https://golangci-lint.run/product/changelog/#200).

- `i3status-rust`-package no longer enables `notmuch` by default. It can be enabled via `withNotmuch`.

- `ocis-bin` has been renamed to `ocis_5-bin`. Future versions will have the major version suffix.

- Default ICU version updated from 74 to 76

- Apache Kafka was updated to `>= 4.0.0`. Please note that this is the first release which operates
  entirely without Apache ZooKeeper support, and all clusters need to be migrated to KRaft mode. See
  the [release announcement](https://kafka.apache.org/blog#apache_kafka_400_release_announcement)
  for more details.

- `ast-grep` remove `sg` command to prevent conflict with `sg` command from shadow-utils. If you need legacy sg command compatibility with old code, you can use `ast-grep.override { enableLegacySg = true; }`

- rename package `wtf` to `wtfutil`.

- `python3Packages.beancount` was updated to 3.1.0. Previous major version remains available as `python3Packages.beancount_2`.

- `wastebin` has been updated to 3.0.0. See the [Changelog](https://github.com/matze/wastebin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300) for breaking changes to the configuration.

- `binwalk` was updated to 3.1.0, which has been rewritten in rust. The python module is no longer available.
  See the release notes of [3.1.0](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/releases/tag/v3.1.0) for more information.

- `pkgs.nextcloud28` has been removed since it's out of support upstream.

- `teleport` has been upgraded from major version 16 to major version 17.
  Refer to [upstream upgrade instructions](https://goteleport.com/docs/upgrading/overview/)
  and [release notes for v17](https://goteleport.com/docs/changelog/#1701-11152024).

- Emacs lisp build helpers, such as `emacs.pkgs.melpaBuild`, now enables `__structuredAttrs` by default.
  Environment variables have to be passed via the `env` attribute.

- `buildGoModule` now passes environment variables via the `env` attribute. `CGO_ENABLED` should now be specified with `env.CGO_ENABLED` when passing to buildGoModule. Direct specification of `CGO_ENABLED` is now redirected by a compatibility layer with a warning, but will become an error in future releases.

  Go-related environment variables previously shadowed by `buildGoModule` now results in errors when specified directly. Such variables include `GOOS` and `GOARCH`.

  Third-party projects supporting both stable and unstable channels could detect this change through the absence of the `CGO_ENABLED` function argument in `buildGoModule` (`!((lib.functionArgs buildGoModule) ? CGO_ENABLED)`).

- `buildGoPackage` has been removed. Use `buildGoModule` instead. See the [Go section in the nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-language-go) for details.

- top-level `playwright` now refers to the github Microsoft/playwright package
  instead of the python tester launcher. You can still refer to the python
  launcher via `python3Packages.toPythonApplication python3Packages.playwright`

- The representation of the flags attributes as shell/environment variables for most Python building setup hooks are now the same as `stdenv.mkDerivation` and other build helpers -- they are space-separated environment variables when `__structuredAttrs = false` and Bash arrays when `__structuredAttrs = true`, and are concatenated to the command without Bash-evaluation. The following behaviour changes are introduced during the conversion:

  - The following flags are no longer Bash-expanded before concatenated to the command:
    - `disabledTests` and `disabledTestPaths` for `pytestCheckHook`. (`disabledTestPaths` used to be expanded twice before concatenation.)
    - `setupPyBuildFlags` and `setupPyGlobalFlags` for `setuptoolsBuildHook`.

  - `pytestFlags` and `unittestFlags` replace `pytestFlagsArray` and `unittestFlagsArray` and become the new and conforming interface.

  - `pytestFlagsArray` and `unittestFlagsArray` are kept for compatibility purposes. They continue to be Bash-expanded before concatenated. This compatibility layer will be removed in future releases.

- The `haka` package and module has been removed because the package was broken and unmaintained for 9 years.

- `strawberry` has been updated to 1.2, which drops support for the VLC backend and Qt 5. The `strawberry-qt5` package
  and `withGstreamer`/`withVlc` override options have been removed due to this.

- `nezha` and its agent `nezha-agent` have been updated to v1, which contains breaking changes. See the [official wiki](https://nezha.wiki/en_US/) for more details.

- `ps3-disc-dumper` was updated to 4.2.5, which removed the CLI project and now exclusively offers the GUI

- `kmonad` is now hardened by default using common `systemd` settings.
  If KMonad is used to execute shell commands, hardening may make some of them fail.  In that case, you can disable hardening using {option}`services.kmonad.keyboards.<name>.enableHardening` option.

- `isd` was updated from 0.2.0 to 0.5.1, the new version may crash with a previously generated config, try moving or deleting `~/.config/isd/schema.json`.

- `uwsgi` no longer supports Python 2 plugins.

- Support for CUDA 10 has been dropped, as announced in the 24.11 release notes.

- `mepo` was updated to version 1.3.3.  The manual page was removed,
  a new JSON API was introduced to replace Mepolang for configuration,
  and a few default key bindings were changed.
  See the [1.3.0 changelog](https://git.sr.ht/~mil/mepo/refs/1.3.0)
  for more details.

- `mkBinaryCache` now defaults to using `zstd` compression for the binary caches it creates. The previous `xz` compression method can be used by passing `compression = "xz";`.

- `nodePackages."@commitlint/config-conventional"` has been removed, as it is a library, and projects should depend on it instead.

-  zigbee2mqtt is now available in version 2.x as `zigbee2mqtt_2`. In NixOS 25.11 we'll remove `zigbee2mqtt_1` and default to `zigbee2mqtt_2`. See the [breaking changes](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/discussions/24198) announcement for 2.0.0.

- `nodePackages.vls` has been deprecated, as the upstream consumer of it, vetur, has been deprecated by upstream. Upstream suggests migrating to Volar for Vue LSP tooling instead.

- `nodePackages.create-react-native-app` has been removed, as it is deprecated. Upstream suggests using a framework for React Native apps instead.

- `nodePackages.insect` has been removed, as it's deprecated by upstream. The suggested replacement is `numbat`.

- `nodePackages.webpack-dev-server` has been removed, as it should be installed in projects that use it instead.

- `nodePackages.copy-webpack-plugin` has been removed, as it should be installed in projects that use it instead.

- `himalaya` has been updated from `v1.0.0-beta.4` to `v1.1.0`, which introduces breaking changes. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya/releases) for details.

- `linuxPackages.nvidiaPackages.dc_520` has been removed since it is marked broken and there are better newer alternatives.

- `pnpm` was updated to version 10. If your project is incompatible, you can install the previous version from the package attribute `pnpm_9`.

- `zig_0_9` and `zig_0_10` have been removed, you should upgrade to `zig_0_13` (also available as just `zig`), `zig_0_12` or `zig_0_11` instead.

- `webpack-cli` was updated to major version 6, which has breaking changes from the previous version 5.1.4. See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/releases/tag/webpack-cli%406.0.0) for details on these changes.

- `minetest` has been renamed to `luanti` to match the upstream name change but aliases have been added. The new name hasn't resulted in many changes as of yet but older references to minetest should be sunset. See the [new name announcement](https://blog.minetest.net/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/) for more details.

- `poac` has been renamed to `cabinpkg` to match the upstream name change but an alias has been added. See the [new name announcement](https://github.com/orgs/cabinpkg/discussions/1052) for more details.

- `serious-sans` has been removed because upstream changed its name to Serious Shanns, which is not currently packaged.

- `racket_7_9` has been removed, as it is insecure. It is recommended to use Racket 8 instead.

- `rofi` has been updated from 1.7.5 to 1.7.6 which introduces some breaking changes to binary plugins, and also contains a lot of new features and bug fixes. This is highlighted because the patch version bump does not indicate the volume of changes by itself. See the [upstream release notes](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/releases/tag/1.7.6) for the full list of changes.

- `ente-auth` now uses the name `enteauth` for its binary. The previous name was `ente_auth`.

- `foundationdb` was upgraded to 7.3.

- `fluxus` has been removed, as it depends on `racket_7_9` and had no updates in 9 years.

- `sm64ex-coop` has been removed as it was archived upstream. Consider migrating to `sm64coopdx`.

- `tldr` now uses [`tldr-python-client`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client) instead of [`tldr-c-client`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-c-client) which is unmaintained.

- `renovate` was updated to v39. See the [upstream release notes](https://docs.renovatebot.com/release-notes-for-major-versions/#version-39) for breaking changes.
  Like upstream's docker images, renovate now runs on NodeJS 22.

- The behavior of the `networking.nat.externalIP` and `networking.nat.externalIPv6` options has been changed. `networking.nat.forwardPorts` now only forwards packets destined for the specified IP addresses.

- `python3Packages.bpycv` has been removed due to being incompatible with Blender 4 and unmaintained.

- `python3Packages.jaeger-client` was removed because it was deprecated upstream. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is the recommended replacement.

- `nodePackages.meshcommander` has been removed, as the package was deprecated by Intel.

- The default version of `z3` has been updated from 4.8 to 4.13. There are still a few packages that need specific older versions; those will continue to be maintained as long as other packages depend on them but may be removed in the future.

- `prometheus` has been updated from 2.55.0 to 3.1.0.
  Read the [release blog post](https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/11/14/prometheus-3-0/) and
  [migration guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.1/migration/).

- `kanata` was updated to v1.8.0, which introduces several breaking changes.
  See the release notes of
  [v1.7.0](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.7.0) and
  [v1.8.0](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
  for more information.

- `authelia` version 4.39.0 has made changes on the default claims for ID Tokens, to mirror the standard claims from the specification.
  This change may affect some clients in unexpected ways, so manual intervention may be required.
  Read the [release notes](https://www.authelia.com/blog/4.39-release-notes/), along with [the guide](https://www.authelia.com/integration/openid-connect/openid-connect-1.0-claims/#restore-functionality-prior-to-claims-parameter) to work around issues that may be encountered.

- `ags` was updated to v2, which is just a CLI for Astal now. Components are available as a different package set `astal.*`.
  If you want to use v1, it is available as `ags_1` package.

  See the release notes of
  [v2.0.0](https://github.com/Aylur/ags/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
  for more information.

- `nodePackages.expo-cli` has been removed, as it was deprecated by upstream. The suggested replacement is the `npx expo` command.

- `open-policy-agent` has has been updated to 1.0.0+.
  This major release makes the `rego.v1` syntax the default.
  This is a breaking change for those using v0 Rego.
  See the [upgrade documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v1.0.1/v0-upgrade/) for more details.
  For those unable to upgrade yet, there is a [v0 compatibility mode](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v1.0.1/v0-compatibility/)
  available too.

- `vscode-utils.buildVscodeExtension` now requires pname as an argument

- `nerdfonts` has been separated into individual font packages under the namespace `nerd-fonts`. The directories for font
  files have changed from `$out/share/fonts/{opentype,truetype}/NerdFonts` to
  `$out/share/fonts/{opentype,truetype}/NerdFonts/<fontDirName>`, where `<fontDirName>` can be found in the
  [official website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) as the titles in preview images, with the "Nerd Font"
  suffix and any whitespaces trimmed. Configuration changes are required, see build output.

- `retroarch` has been refactored and the older `retroarch.override { cores = [ ... ]; }` to create a RetroArch derivation with custom cores doesn't work anymore, use `retroarch.withCores (cores: [ ... ])` instead. If you need more customization (e.g.: custom settings), use `wrapRetroArch` instead.

- `borgmatic` has been updated from 1.8.14 to 1.9.5, please check the [upstream changelog](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/releases) for more details, especially for a few possibly breaking changes noted in the [1.9.0 changelog](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/releases/tag/1.9.0).

- `nodePackages.ganache` has been removed, as the package has been deprecated by upstream.

- `matomo` now defaults to version 5 (previously available as `matomo_5`). Version 4 has been removed as it reached EOL on December 19, 2024.

- `matomo-beta` has been removed as the version of the `matomo` package can now be easily overridden through `overrideAttrs` (see [PR #374022](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/374022))

- `docker_24` has been removed, as it was EOL with vulnerabilities since June 08, 2024.

- Emacs 28 and 29 have been removed.

- `containerd` has been updated to v2, which contains breaking changes. See the [containerd
  2.0](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/containerd-2.0.md) documentation for more
  details.

- `nodePackages.stackdriver-statsd-backend` has been removed, as the StackDriver service has been discontinued by Google, and therefore the package no longer works.

- `python3Packages.opentracing` has been removed due to being unmaintained upstream. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is the recommended replacement.

- the notmuch vim plugin now lives in a separate output of the `notmuch`
  package. Installing `notmuch` will not bring the notmuch vim package anymore,
  add `vimPlugins.notmuch-vim` to your (Neo)vim configuration if you want the
  vim plugin.

- `prisma` and `prisma-engines` have been updated to version 6.3.0, which
  introduces several breaking changes. See the
  [Prisma ORM upgrade guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-6)
  for more information.

- `depdendency-track` no longer bundes the UI inside the jar. This bundling
  functionality is deprecated by upstream and causes UI assets not being served
  after weeks of runtime.

- `nq` was updated to 1.0, which renames the `fq` and `tq` utilities to `nqtail` and `nqterm` respectively.

- `zf` was updated to 0.10.2, which includes breaking changes from the [0.10.0 release](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf/releases/tag/0.10.0).
  `zf` no longer does Unicode normalization of the input and no longer supports terminal escape sequences in the `ZF_PROMPT` environment variable.

- `confluent-cli` was updated from 3.60.0 to 4.16.0, which includes several breaking changes as detailed in [Confluent's release notes](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/release-notes.html).

- `siduck76-st` has been renamed to `st-snazzy`, like the project's [flake](https://github.com/siduck/st/blob/main/flake.nix).

- `python3Packages.jax` now directly depends on `python3Packages.jaxlib`.
  As a result, packages that depend on jax no longer need to include jaxlib to their dependencies.
  There is also a breaking change in the handling of CUDA. Instead of using a CUDA compatible jaxlib
  as before, you can use plugins like `python3Packages.jax-cuda12-plugin`.

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-notable-changes}

- `titaniumenv`, `titanium`, and `titanium-alloy` have been removed due to lack of maintenance in Nixpkgs []{#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-incompatibilities-titanium-removed}.

- `gerbera` now has wavpack support.

- GOverlay has been updated to 1.2, please check the [upstream changelog](https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/releases) for more details.

- For matrix homeserver Synapse we are now following the upstream recommendation to enable jemalloc as the memory allocator by default.

- In `dovecot` package removed hard coding path to module directory.

- `ddclient` was updated from 3.11.2 to 4.0.0 [Release notes](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

### NexusMods.App upgraded {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-incompatibilities-nexusmods-app-upgraded}

- `nexusmods-app` has been upgraded from version 0.6.3 to 0.8.3.

  - Before upgrading, you **must reset all app state** (mods, games, settings, etc). NexusMods.App will crash if any state from a version older than 0.7.0 is still present.

  - Typically, you can can reset to a clean state by running `NexusMods.App uninstall-app`. See Nexus Mod's [how to uninstall the app](https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/Uninstall) documentation for more detail and alternative methods.

  - This should not be necessary going forward, because loading app state from 0.7.0 or newer is now supported. This is documented in the [0.7.1 changelog](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.7.1).

## Nixpkgs Library {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-lib}

### Breaking changes {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-lib-breaking}

- Structure of the `functor` of some types has changed. `functor` is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon. If you did rely on it let us know in this [PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/363565).
  - [`lib.types.enum`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-option-types-basic): Previously the `functor.payload` was the list of enum values directly. Now it is an attribute set containing the values in the `values` attribute.
  - [`lib.types.separatedString`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-option-types-string): Previously the `functor.payload` was the separator directly. Now it is an attribute set containing the separator in the `sep` attribute.

- The `tinycc` package now has the `dev`, `doc` and `lib` outputs, thus,
`tinycc.out` may now only provide the tcc and cross compilers binaries.

- The `virtualisation.hypervGuest.videoMode` option has been removed. Standard tooling can now be used to configure display modes for Hyper-V VMs.

- [`lib.packagesFromDirectoryRecursive`] now rejects unknown arguments.
  [`lib.packagesFromDirectoryRecursive`]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#function-library-lib.filesystem.packagesFromDirectoryRecursive

### Deprecations {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-lib-deprecations}

- `functor` is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon, but since its status wasn't clear and it has had some use cases without alternatives, changes are being handled as gracefully as possible. Deprecations within functor:
  - `functor.wrapped` is now deprecated for some types and using it will give a warning with migration instructions. It is deprecated for these types:
    - `lib.types.attrsWith`
    - `lib.types.listOf`
    - `lib.types.unique` and `lib.types.uniq`
    - `lib.types.nullOr`
    - `lib.types.functionTo`
    - `lib.types.coercedTo`
    - `lib.types.either`

- Plasma 5 and Qt 5 based versions of associated software are deprecated in NixOS 25.05, and will be removed in NixOS 25.11. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Plasma 6.

- `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` stops handling the deprecated argument `cargoSha256`. Out-of-tree packages that haven't migrated from `cargoSha256` to `cargoHash` now receive errors.

### Additions and Improvements {#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.05-lib-additions-improvements}

- [`lib.packagesFromDirectoryRecursive`] can now construct nested scopes matching the directory tree passed as input.
