## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `spoof` has been removed, as there are many issues upstream with it working on modern OS versions, and it appears to be unmaintained.

- All Log4Shell vulnerability scanners were removed, as they were all unmaintained upstream and are no longer relevant given that the vulnerability has been fixed upstream for several years.

- `python3packages.pillow-avif-plugin` has been removed as the functionality is included in `python3packages.pillow` directly since version 11.3.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `uptime-kuma` has been updated to v2, which requires an automated migration that can take a few hours. **A backup is highly recommended.**
  If your SQLite database is corrupted, the migration might fail and require [manual intervention](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/5281).
  See the [migration guide](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Migration-From-v1-To-v2) for more information.
