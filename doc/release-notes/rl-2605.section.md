# Nixpkgs 26.05 ("Yarara", 2026.05/??) {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05}

## Highlights {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05-highlights}
<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- GCC has been updated from GCC 14 to GCC 15.
  This introduces some backwards incompatible changes; Refer to the [upstream porting guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-15/porting_to.html) for details.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `spoof` has been removed, as there are many issues upstream with it working on modern OS versions, and it appears to be unmaintained.

- `kanata` now requires `karabiner-dk` version 6.0+ or later.
  The package has been updated to use the new `karabiner-dk` package and the `darwinDriver` output stays at the version defined in the package.

- All Log4Shell vulnerability scanners were removed, as they were all unmaintained upstream and are no longer relevant given that the vulnerability has been fixed upstream for several years.

- `python3packages.pillow-avif-plugin` has been removed as the functionality is included in `python3packages.pillow` directly since version 11.3.

## Other Notable Changes {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05-notable-changes}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `uptime-kuma` has been updated to v2, which requires an automated migration that can take a few hours. **A backup is highly recommended.**
  If your SQLite database is corrupted, the migration might fail and require [manual intervention](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/5281).
  See the [migration guide](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Migration-From-v1-To-v2) for more information.
