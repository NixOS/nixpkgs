- `spoof` has been removed, as there are many issues upstream with it working on modern OS versions, and it appears to be unmaintained.

- All Log4Shell vulnerability scanners were removed, as they were all unmaintained upstream and are no longer relevant given that the vulnerability has been fixed upstream for several years.

- `python3packages.pillow-avif-plugin` has been removed as the functionality is included in `python3packages.pillow` directly since version 11.3.
