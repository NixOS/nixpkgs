## Highlights {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05-highlights}
<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- GCC has been updated from GCC 14 to GCC 15.
  This introduces some backwards incompatible changes; Refer to the [upstream porting guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-15/porting_to.html) for details.

## Backward Incompatibilities {#sec-nixpkgs-release-26.05-incompatibilities}

<!-- To avoid merge conflicts, consider adding your item at an arbitrary place in the list instead. -->

- `spoof` has been removed, as there are many issues upstream with it working on modern OS versions, and it appears to be unmaintained.

- All Log4Shell vulnerability scanners were removed, as they were all unmaintained upstream and are no longer relevant given that the vulnerability has been fixed upstream for several years.

- `python3packages.pillow-avif-plugin` has been removed as the functionality is included in `python3packages.pillow` directly since version 11.3.
