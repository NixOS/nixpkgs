# treefmt {#treefmt}

[treefmt](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt) streamlines the process of applying formatters to your project, making it a breeze with just one command line.

The [`treefmt` package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=treefmt)
provides functions for configuring treefmt using the module system, which are [documented below](#sec-functions-library-treefmt).

Alternatively, treefmt can be configured using [treefmt-nix](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt-nix).
