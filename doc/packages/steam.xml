   <title>Steam in Nix</title>

   <para>
    Steam is distributed as a <filename>.deb</filename> file, for now only as an i686 package (the amd64 package only has documentation). When unpacked, it has a script called <filename>steam</filename> that in Ubuntu (their target distro) would go to <filename>/usr/bin </filename>. When run for the first time, this script copies some files to the user's home, which include another script that is the ultimate responsible for launching the steam binary, which is also in $HOME.

    The current approach to deploy Steam in NixOS is composing a FHS-compatible chroot environment, as documented <link xlink:href="http://sandervanderburg.blogspot.nl/2013/09/composing-fhs-compatible-chroot.html">here</link>. This allows us to have binaries in the expected paths without disrupting the system, and to avoid patching them to work in a non FHS environment.

    For 64-bit systems it's important to have
<programlisting>hardware.opengl.driSupport32Bit = true;</programlisting>
    in your <filename>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</filename>. You'll also need
<programlisting>hardware.pulseaudio.support32Bit = true;</programlisting>
    if you are using PulseAudio - this will enable 32bit ALSA apps integration. To use the Steam controller or other Steam supported controllers such as the DualShock 4 or Nintendo Switch Pro, you need to add
<programlisting>hardware.steam-hardware.enable = true;</programlisting>
    to your configuration.

    The FHS-compatible chroot used for steam can also be used to run other linux games that expect a FHS environment. To do it, add
<programlisting>pkgs.(steam.override {
          nativeOnly = true;
          newStdcpp = true;
        }).run</programlisting>
    to your configuration, rebuild, and run the game with
<programlisting>steam-run ./foo</programlisting>
