   <title>Compiling without AVX support</title>

   <para>
    Especially older CPUs don't support <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</link> (<abbrev>Advanced Vector Extensions</abbrev>) instructions that are used by DLib to optimize their algorithms.
   </para>

   <para>
    On the affected hardware errors like <literal>Illegal instruction</literal> will occur. In those cases AVX support needs to be disabled:
<programlisting>self: super: {
  dlib = super.dlib.override { avxSupport = false; };
}</programlisting>
