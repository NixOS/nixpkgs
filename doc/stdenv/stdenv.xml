 <title>The Standard Environment</title>
 <para>
  The standard build environment in the Nix Packages collection provides an environment for building Unix packages that does a lot of common build tasks automatically. In fact, for Unix packages that use the standard <literal>./configure; make; make install</literal> build interface, you don’t need to write a build script at all; the standard environment does everything automatically. If <literal>stdenv</literal> doesn’t do what you need automatically, you can easily customise or override the various build phases.
 </para>
 <section xml:id="sec-using-stdenv">
  <title>Using <literal>stdenv</literal></title>

  <para>
   To build a package with the standard environment, you use the function <varname>stdenv.mkDerivation</varname>, instead of the primitive built-in function <varname>derivation</varname>, e.g.
<programlisting>
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "libfoo-1.2.3";
  src = fetchurl {
    url = "http://example.org/libfoo-1.2.3.tar.bz2";
    sha256 = "0x2g1jqygyr5wiwg4ma1nd7w4ydpy82z9gkcv8vh2v8dn3y58v5m";
  };
}</programlisting>
   (<varname>stdenv</varname> needs to be in scope, so if you write this in a separate Nix expression from <filename>pkgs/all-packages.nix</filename>, you need to pass it as a function argument.) Specifying a <varname>name</varname> and a <varname>src</varname> is the absolute minimum Nix requires. For convenience, you can also use <varname>pname</varname> and <varname>version</varname> attributes and <literal>mkDerivation</literal> will automatically set <varname>name</varname> to <literal>"${pname}-${version}"</literal> by default. Since <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/35">RFC 0035</link>, this is preferred for packages in Nixpkgs, as it allows us to reuse the version easily:
<programlisting>
stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  pname = "libfoo";
  version = "1.2.3";
  src = fetchurl {
    url = "http://example.org/libfoo-source-${version}.tar.bz2";
    sha256 = "0x2g1jqygyr5wiwg4ma1nd7w4ydpy82z9gkcv8vh2v8dn3y58v5m";
  };
}</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Many packages have dependencies that are not provided in the standard environment. It’s usually sufficient to specify those dependencies in the <varname>buildInputs</varname> attribute:
<programlisting>
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "libfoo-1.2.3";
  ...
  buildInputs = [libbar perl ncurses];
}</programlisting>
   This attribute ensures that the <filename>bin</filename> subdirectories of these packages appear in the <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable during the build, that their <filename>include</filename> subdirectories are searched by the C compiler, and so on. (See <xref linkend="ssec-setup-hooks"/> for details.)
  </para>

  <para>
   Often it is necessary to override or modify some aspect of the build. To make this easier, the standard environment breaks the package build into a number of <emphasis>phases</emphasis>, all of which can be overridden or modified individually: unpacking the sources, applying patches, configuring, building, and installing. (There are some others; see <xref linkend="sec-stdenv-phases"/>.) For instance, a package that doesn’t supply a makefile but instead has to be compiled “manually” could be handled like this:
<programlisting>
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "fnord-4.5";
  ...
  buildPhase = ''
    gcc foo.c -o foo
  '';
  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out/bin
    cp foo $out/bin
  '';
}</programlisting>
   (Note the use of <literal>''</literal>-style string literals, which are very convenient for large multi-line script fragments because they don’t need escaping of <literal>"</literal> and <literal>\</literal>, and because indentation is intelligently removed.)
  </para>

  <para>
   There are many other attributes to customise the build. These are listed in <xref linkend="ssec-stdenv-attributes"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   While the standard environment provides a generic builder, you can still supply your own build script:
<programlisting>
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "libfoo-1.2.3";
  ...
  builder = ./builder.sh;
}</programlisting>
   where the builder can do anything it wants, but typically starts with
<programlisting>
source $stdenv/setup
</programlisting>
   to let <literal>stdenv</literal> set up the environment (e.g., process the <varname>buildInputs</varname>). If you want, you can still use <literal>stdenv</literal>’s generic builder:
<programlisting>
source $stdenv/setup

buildPhase() {
  echo "... this is my custom build phase ..."
  gcc foo.c -o foo
}

installPhase() {
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp foo $out/bin
}

  <title>Specifying dependencies</title>

  <para>
   As described in the Nix manual, almost any <filename>*.drv</filename> store path in a derivation's attribute set will induce a dependency on that derivation. <varname>mkDerivation</varname>, however, takes a few attributes intended to, between them, include all the dependencies of a package. This is done both for structure and consistency, but also so that certain other setup can take place. For example, certain dependencies need their bin directories added to the <envar>PATH</envar>. That is built-in, but other setup is done via a pluggable mechanism that works in conjunction with these dependency attributes. See <xref linkend="ssec-setup-hooks"/> for details.
  </para>

  <para>
   Dependencies can be broken down along three axes: their host and target platforms relative to the new derivation's, and whether they are propagated. The platform distinctions are motivated by cross compilation; see <xref linkend="chap-cross"/> for exactly what each platform means.
   <footnote xml:id="footnote-stdenv-ignored-build-platform">
    <para>
     The build platform is ignored because it is a mere implementation detail of the package satisfying the dependency: As a general programming principle, dependencies are always <emphasis>specified</emphasis> as interfaces, not concrete implementation.
    </para>
   </footnote>
   But even if one is not cross compiling, the platforms imply whether or not the dependency is needed at run-time or build-time, a concept that makes perfect sense outside of cross compilation. By default, the run-time/build-time distinction is just a hint for mental clarity, but with <varname>strictDeps</varname> set it is mostly enforced even in the native case.
  </para>

  <para>
   The extension of <envar>PATH</envar> with dependencies, alluded to above, proceeds according to the relative platforms alone. The process is carried out only for dependencies whose host platform matches the new derivation's build platform i.e. dependencies which run on the platform where the new derivation will be built.
   <footnote xml:id="footnote-stdenv-native-dependencies-in-path">
    <para>
     Currently, this means for native builds all dependencies are put on the <envar>PATH</envar>. But in the future that may not be the case for sake of matching cross: the platforms would be assumed to be unique for native and cross builds alike, so only the <varname>depsBuild*</varname> and <varname>nativeBuildInputs</varname> would be added to the <envar>PATH</envar>.
    </para>
   </footnote>
   For each dependency <replaceable>dep</replaceable> of those dependencies, <filename><replaceable>dep</replaceable>/bin</filename>, if present, is added to the <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable.
  </para>

  <para>
   The dependency is propagated when it forces some of its other-transitive (non-immediate) downstream dependencies to also take it on as an immediate dependency. Nix itself already takes a package's transitive dependencies into account, but this propagation ensures nixpkgs-specific infrastructure like setup hooks (mentioned above) also are run as if the propagated dependency.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is important to note that dependencies are not necessarily propagated as the same sort of dependency that they were before, but rather as the corresponding sort so that the platform rules still line up. The exact rules for dependency propagation can be given by assigning to each dependency two integers based one how its host and target platforms are offset from the depending derivation's platforms. Those offsets are given below in the descriptions of each dependency list attribute. Algorithmically, we traverse propagated inputs, accumulating every propagated dependency's propagated dependencies and adjusting them to account for the "shift in perspective" described by the current dependency's platform offsets. This results in sort a transitive closure of the dependency relation, with the offsets being approximately summed when two dependency links are combined. We also prune transitive dependencies whose combined offsets go out-of-bounds, which can be viewed as a filter over that transitive closure removing dependencies that are blatantly absurd.
  </para>

  <para>
   We can define the process precisely with <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction">Natural Deduction</link> using the inference rules. This probably seems a bit obtuse, but so is the bash code that actually implements it!
   <footnote xml:id="footnote-stdenv-find-inputs-location">
    <para>
     The <function>findInputs</function> function, currently residing in <filename>pkgs/stdenv/generic/setup.sh</filename>, implements the propagation logic.
    </para>
   </footnote>
   They're confusing in very different ways so... hopefully if something doesn't make sense in one presentation, it will in the other!
<programlisting>
let mapOffset(h, t, i) = i + (if i &lt;= 0 then h else t - 1)

h0 + h1 in {-1, 0, 1}
h0 + t1 in {-1, 0, 1}
-------------------------------------- Transitive property
propagated-dep(mapOffset(h0, t0, h1),
               mapOffset(h0, t0, t1),
               A, C)</programlisting>
<programlisting>
let mapOffset(h, t, i) = i + (if i &lt;= 0 then h else t - 1)

dep(h0, _, A, B)
propagated-dep(h1, t1, B, C)
h0 + h1 in {-1, 0, 1}
h0 + t1 in {-1, 0, -1}
----------------------------- Take immediate dependencies' propagated dependencies
propagated-dep(mapOffset(h0, t0, h1),
               mapOffset(h0, t0, t1),
               A, C)</programlisting>
<programlisting>
propagated-dep(h, t, A, B)
----------------------------- Propagated dependencies count as dependencies
dep(h, t, A, B)</programlisting>
   Some explanation of this monstrosity is in order. In the common case, the target offset of a dependency is the successor to the target offset: <literal>t = h + 1</literal>. That means that:
<programlisting>
let f(h, t, i) = i + (if i &lt;= 0 then h else t - 1)
let f(h, h + 1, i) = i + (if i &lt;= 0 then h else (h + 1) - 1)
let f(h, h + 1, i) = i + (if i &lt;= 0 then h else h)
let f(h, h + 1, i) = i + h
</programlisting>
   This is where "sum-like" comes in from above: We can just sum all of the host offsets to get the host offset of the transitive dependency. The target offset is the transitive dependency is simply the host offset + 1, just as it was with the dependencies composed to make this transitive one; it can be ignored as it doesn't add any new information.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because of the bounds checks, the uncommon cases are <literal>h = t</literal> and <literal>h + 2 = t</literal>. In the former case, the motivation for <function>mapOffset</function> is that since its host and target platforms are the same, no transitive dependency of it should be able to "discover" an offset greater than its reduced target offsets. <function>mapOffset</function> effectively "squashes" all its transitive dependencies' offsets so that none will ever be greater than the target offset of the original <literal>h = t</literal> package. In the other case, <literal>h + 1</literal> is skipped over between the host and target offsets. Instead of squashing the offsets, we need to "rip" them apart so no transitive dependencies' offset is that one.
  </para>

  <para>
   Overall, the unifying theme here is that propagation shouldn't be introducing transitive dependencies involving platforms the depending package is unaware of. [One can imagine the dependending package asking for dependencies with the platforms it knows about; other platforms it doesn't know how to ask for. The platform description in that scenario is a kind of unforagable capability.] The offset bounds checking and definition of <function>mapOffset</function> together ensure that this is the case. Discovering a new offset is discovering a new platform, and since those platforms weren't in the derivation "spec" of the needing package, they cannot be relevant. From a capability perspective, we can imagine that the host and target platforms of a package are the capabilities a package requires, and the depending package must provide the capability to the dependency.

This means a <literal>-1</literal> host offset and <literal>1</literal> target offset from the new derivation's platforms. These are programs used at build time that produce code to run with code produced by the depending package. Most commonly, these are tools used to build the runtime or standard library that the currently-being-built compiler will inject into any code it compiles. In many cases, the currently-being-built-compiler is itself employed for that task, but when that compiler won't run (i.e. its build and host platform differ) this is not possible. Other times, the compiler relies on some other tool, like binutils, that is always built separately so that the dependency is unconditional.
     </para>
     <para>
      This is a somewhat confusing concept to wrap one’s head around, and for good reason. As the only dependency type where the platform offsets are not adjacent integers, it requires thinking of a bootstrapping stage <emphasis>two</emphasis> away from the current one. It and its use-case go hand in hand and are both considered poor form: try to not need this sort of dependency, and try to avoid building standard libraries and runtimes in the same derivation as the compiler produces code using them. Instead strive to build those like a normal library, using the newly-built compiler just as a normal library would. In short, do not use this attribute unless you are packaging a compiler and are sure it is needed.

     <para>
      This is an attribute set which can be filled with arbitrary values. For example:
<programlisting>
passthru = {
  foo = "bar";
  baz = {
    value1 = 4;
    value2 = 5;
  };
}
</programlisting>
     </para>
     <para>
      Values inside it are not passed to the builder, so you can change them without triggering a rebuild. However, they can be accessed outside of a derivation directly, as if they were set inside a derivation itself, e.g. <literal>hello.baz.value1</literal>. We don't specify any usage or schema of <literal>passthru</literal> - it is meant for values that would be useful outside the derivation in other parts of a Nix expression (e.g. in other derivations). An example would be to convey some specific dependency of your derivation which contains a program with plugins support. Later, others who make derivations with plugins can use passed-through dependency to ensure that their plugin would be binary-compatible with built program.

  <title>Phases</title>

  <para>
   The generic builder has a number of <emphasis>phases</emphasis>. Package builds are split into phases to make it easier to override specific parts of the build (e.g., unpacking the sources or installing the binaries). Furthermore, it allows a nicer presentation of build logs in the Nix build farm.
  </para>

  <para>
   Each phase can be overridden in its entirety either by setting the environment variable <varname><replaceable>name</replaceable>Phase</varname> to a string containing some shell commands to be executed, or by redefining the shell function <varname><replaceable>name</replaceable>Phase</varname>. The former is convenient to override a phase from the derivation, while the latter is convenient from a build script. However, typically one only wants to <emphasis>add</emphasis> some commands to a phase, e.g. by defining <literal>postInstall</literal> or <literal>preFixup</literal>, as skipping some of the default actions may have unexpected consequences. The default script for each phase is defined in the file <filename>pkgs/stdenv/generic/setup.sh</filename>.

  <title>Package setup hooks</title>

  <para>
   Nix itself considers a build-time dependency as merely something that should previously be built and accessible at build time—packages themselves are on their own to perform any additional setup. In most cases, that is fine, and the downstream derivation can deal with its own dependencies. But for a few common tasks, that would result in almost every package doing the same sort of setup work—depending not on the package itself, but entirely on which dependencies were used.
  </para>

  <para>
   In order to alleviate this burden, the <firstterm>setup hook</firstterm> mechanism was written, where any package can include a shell script that [by convention rather than enforcement by Nix], any downstream reverse-dependency will source as part of its build process. That allows the downstream dependency to merely specify its dependencies, and lets those dependencies effectively initialize themselves. No boilerplate mirroring the list of dependencies is needed.
  </para>

  <para>
   The setup hook mechanism is a bit of a sledgehammer though: a powerful feature with a broad and indiscriminate area of effect. The combination of its power and implicit use may be expedient, but isn't without costs. Nix itself is unchanged, but the spirit of added dependencies being effect-free is violated even if the letter isn't. For example, if a derivation path is mentioned more than once, Nix itself doesn't care and simply makes sure the dependency derivation is already built just the same—depending is just needing something to exist, and needing is idempotent. However, a dependency specified twice will have its setup hook run twice, and that could easily change the build environment (though a well-written setup hook will therefore strive to be idempotent so this is in fact not observable). More broadly, setup hooks are anti-modular in that multiple dependencies, whether the same or different, should not interfere and yet their setup hooks may well do so.
  </para>

  <para>
   The most typical use of the setup hook is actually to add other hooks which are then run (i.e. after all the setup hooks) on each dependency. For example, the C compiler wrapper's setup hook feeds itself flags for each dependency that contains relevant libraries and headers. This is done by defining a bash function, and appending its name to one of <envar>envBuildBuildHooks</envar>, <envar>envBuildHostHooks</envar>, <envar>envBuildTargetHooks</envar>, <envar>envHostHostHooks</envar>, <envar>envHostTargetHooks</envar>, or <envar>envTargetTargetHooks</envar>. These 6 bash variables correspond to the 6 sorts of dependencies by platform (there's 12 total but we ignore the propagated/non-propagated axis).
  </para>

  <para>
   Packages adding a hook should not hard code a specific hook, but rather choose a variable <emphasis>relative</emphasis> to how they are included. Returning to the C compiler wrapper example, if the wrapper itself is an <literal>n</literal> dependency, then it only wants to accumulate flags from <literal>n + 1</literal> dependencies, as only those ones match the compiler's target platform. The <envar>hostOffset</envar> variable is defined with the current dependency's host offset <envar>targetOffset</envar> with its target offset, before its setup hook is sourced. Additionally, since most environment hooks don't care about the target platform, that means the setup hook can append to the right bash array by doing something like
<programlisting language="bash">
addEnvHooks "$hostOffset" myBashFunction
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   The <emphasis>existence</emphasis> of setups hooks has long been documented and packages inside Nixpkgs are free to use this mechanism. Other packages, however, should not rely on these mechanisms not changing between Nixpkgs versions. Because of the existing issues with this system, there's little benefit from mandating it be stable for any period of time.
  </para>

  <para>
   First, let’s cover some setup hooks that are part of Nixpkgs default stdenv. This means that they are run for every package built using <function>stdenv.mkDerivation</function>. Some of these are platform specific, so they may run on Linux but not Darwin or vice-versa.

      Bintools Wrapper
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The Bintools Wrapper wraps the binary utilities for a bunch of miscellaneous purposes. These are GNU Binutils when targetting Linux, and a mix of cctools and GNU binutils for Darwin. [The "Bintools" name is supposed to be a compromise between "Binutils" and "cctools" not denoting any specific implementation.] Specifically, the underlying bintools package, and a C standard library (glibc or Darwin's libSystem, just for the dynamic loader) are all fed in, and dependency finding, hardening (see below), and purity checks for each are handled by the Bintools Wrapper. Packages typically depend on CC Wrapper, which in turn (at run time) depends on the Bintools Wrapper.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bintools Wrapper was only just recently split off from CC Wrapper, so the division of labor is still being worked out. For example, it shouldn't care about the C standard library, but just take a derivation with the dynamic loader (which happens to be the glibc on linux). Dependency finding however is a task both wrappers will continue to need to share, and probably the most important to understand. It is currently accomplished by collecting directories of host-platform dependencies (i.e. <varname>buildInputs</varname> and <varname>nativeBuildInputs</varname>) in environment variables. The Bintools Wrapper's setup hook causes any <filename>lib</filename> and <filename>lib64</filename> subdirectories to be added to <envar>NIX_LDFLAGS</envar>. Since the CC Wrapper and the Bintools Wrapper use the same strategy, most of the Bintools Wrapper code is sparsely commented and refers to the CC Wrapper. But the CC Wrapper's code, by contrast, has quite lengthy comments. The Bintools Wrapper merely cites those, rather than repeating them, to avoid falling out of sync.
      </para>
      <para>
       A final task of the setup hook is defining a number of standard environment variables to tell build systems which executables fulfill which purpose. They are defined to just be the base name of the tools, under the assumption that the Bintools Wrapper's binaries will be on the path. Firstly, this helps poorly-written packages, e.g. ones that look for just <command>gcc</command> when <envar>CC</envar> isn't defined yet <command>clang</command> is to be used. Secondly, this helps packages not get confused when cross-compiling, in which case multiple Bintools Wrappers may simultaneously be in use.
       <footnote xml:id="footnote-stdenv-per-platform-wrapper">
        <para>
         Each wrapper targets a single platform, so if binaries for multiple platforms are needed, the underlying binaries must be wrapped multiple times. As this is a property of the wrapper itself, the multiple wrappings are needed whether or not the same underlying binaries can target multiple platforms.
        </para>
       </footnote>
       <envar>BUILD_</envar>- and <envar>TARGET_</envar>-prefixed versions of the normal environment variable are defined for additional Bintools Wrappers, properly disambiguating them.
      </para>
      <para>
       A problem with this final task is that the Bintools Wrapper is honest and defines <envar>LD</envar> as <command>ld</command>. Most packages, however, firstly use the C compiler for linking, secondly use <envar>LD</envar> anyways, defining it as the C compiler, and thirdly, only so define <envar>LD</envar> when it is undefined as a fallback. This triple-threat means Bintools Wrapper will break those packages, as LD is already defined as the actual linker which the package won't override yet doesn't want to use. The workaround is to define, just for the problematic package, <envar>LD</envar> as the C compiler. A good way to do this would be <command>preConfigure = "LD=$CC"</command>.

     <term>
      CC Wrapper
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The CC Wrapper wraps a C toolchain for a bunch of miscellaneous purposes. Specifically, a C compiler (GCC or Clang), wrapped binary tools, and a C standard library (glibc or Darwin's libSystem, just for the dynamic loader) are all fed in, and dependency finding, hardening (see below), and purity checks for each are handled by the CC Wrapper. Packages typically depend on the CC Wrapper, which in turn (at run-time) depends on the Bintools Wrapper.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dependency finding is undoubtedly the main task of the CC Wrapper. This works just like the Bintools Wrapper, except that any <filename>include</filename> subdirectory of any relevant dependency is added to <envar>NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE</envar>. The setup hook itself contains some lengthy comments describing the exact convoluted mechanism by which this is accomplished.
      </para>
      <para>
       Similarly, the CC Wrapper follows the Bintools Wrapper in defining standard environment variables with the names of the tools it wraps, for the same reasons described above. Importantly, while it includes a <command>cc</command> symlink to the c compiler for portability, the <envar>CC</envar> will be defined using the compiler's "real name" (i.e. <command>gcc</command> or <command>clang</command>). This helps lousy build systems that inspect on the name of the compiler rather than run it.

       In certain situations you may want to run the main command (<command>autoPatchelf</command>) of the setup hook on a file or a set of directories instead of unconditionally patching all outputs. This can be done by setting the <varname>dontAutoPatchelf</varname> environment variable to a non-empty value.
      </para>
      <para>
       By default <command>autoPatchelf</command> will fail as soon as any ELF file requires a dependency which cannot be resolved via the given build inputs. In some situations you might prefer to just leave missing dependencies unpatched and continue to patch the rest. This can be achieved by setting the <envar>autoPatchelfIgnoreMissingDeps</envar> environment variable to a non-empty value.
      </para>
      <para>
       The <command>autoPatchelf</command> command also recognizes a <parameter class="command">--no-recurse</parameter> command line flag, which prevents it from recursing into subdirectories.

       This hook will make a build pause instead of stopping when a failure happens. It prevents nix from cleaning up the build environment immediately and allows the user to attach to a build environment using the <command>cntr</command> command. Upon build error it will print instructions on how to use <command>cntr</command>, which can be used to enter the environment for debugging. Installing cntr and running the command will provide shell access to the build sandbox of failed build. At <filename>/var/lib/cntr</filename> the sandboxed filesystem is mounted. All commands and files of the system are still accessible within the shell. To execute commands from the sandbox use the cntr exec subcommand. <command>cntr</command> is only supported on Linux-based platforms. To use it first add <literal>cntr</literal> to your <literal>environment.systemPackages</literal> on NixOS or alternatively to the root user on non-NixOS systems. Then in the package that is supposed to be inspected, add <literal>breakpointHook</literal> to <literal>nativeBuildInputs</literal>.
<programlisting>
nativeBuildInputs = [ breakpointHook ];
</programlisting>
       When a build failure happens there will be an instruction printed that shows how to attach with <literal>cntr</literal> to the build sandbox.

       This hook helps with installing manpages and shell completion files. It exposes 2 shell functions <literal>installManPage</literal> and <literal>installShellCompletion</literal> that can be used from your <literal>postInstall</literal> hook.
      </para>
      <para>
       The <literal>installManPage</literal> function takes one or more paths to manpages to install. The manpages must have a section suffix, and may optionally be compressed (with <literal>.gz</literal> suffix). This function will place them into the correct directory.
      </para>
      <para>
       The <literal>installShellCompletion</literal> function takes one or more paths to shell completion files. By default it will autodetect the shell type from the completion file extension, but you may also specify it by passing one of <literal>--bash</literal>, <literal>--fish</literal>, or <literal>--zsh</literal>. These flags apply to all paths listed after them (up until another shell flag is given). Each path may also have a custom installation name provided by providing a flag <literal>--name NAME</literal> before the path. If this flag is not provided, zsh completions will be renamed automatically such that <literal>foobar.zsh</literal> becomes <literal>_foobar</literal>.

In addition, dependencies are added automatically to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH so that packages are correctly detected by CMake. Some additional flags are passed in to give similar behavior to configure-based packages. You can disable this hook’s behavior by setting configurePhase to a custom value, or by setting dontUseCmakeConfigure. cmakeFlags controls flags passed only to CMake. By default, parallel building is enabled as CMake supports parallel building almost everywhere. When Ninja is also in use, CMake will detect that and use the ninja generator.

      Signed integer overflow is undefined behaviour according to the C standard. If it happens, it is an error in the program as it should check for overflow before it can happen, not afterwards.

As a workaround, the option <option>-fno-strict-overflow</option> makes gcc behave as if signed integer overflows were defined.

During program load, several ELF memory sections need to be written to by the linker, but can be turned read-only before turning over control to the program.

Position Independent Executables are needed to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization, supported by modern kernel versions. While ASLR can already be enforced for data areas in the stack and heap (brk and mmap), the code areas must be compiled as position-independent. Shared libraries already do this with the <varname>pic</varname> flag, so they gain ASLR automatically, but binary .text regions need to be build with <varname>pie</varname> to gain ASLR. When this happens, ROP attacks are much harder since there are no static locations to bounce off of during a memory corruption attack.
