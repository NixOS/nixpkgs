<title>Phases</title>

<para>The generic builder has a number of <emphasis>phases</emphasis>.
Package builds are split into phases to make it easier to override
specific parts of the build (e.g., unpacking the sources or installing
the binaries).  Furthermore, it allows a nicer presentation of build
logs in the Nix build farm.</para>

<para>Each phase can be overridden in its entirety either by setting
the environment variable
<varname><replaceable>name</replaceable>Phase</varname> to a string
containing some shell commands to be executed, or by redefining the
shell function
<varname><replaceable>name</replaceable>Phase</varname>.  The former
is convenient to override a phase from the derivation, while the
latter is convenient from a build script.</para>
