<para>[measures taken to prevent dependencies on packages outside the
store, and what you can do to prevent them]</para>

<para>GCC doesn't search in locations such as
<filename>/usr/include</filename>.  In fact, attempts to add such
directories through the <option>-I</option> flag are filtered out.
Likewise, the linker (from GNU binutils) doesn't search in standard
locations such as <filename>/usr/lib</filename>.  Programs built on
Linux are linked against a GNU C Library that likewise doesn't search
in the default system locations.</para>
