    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      In this document and related Nix expressions we use the term
      <emphasis>Beam</emphasis> to describe the environment. Beam is
      the name of the Erlang Virtial Machine and, as far as we know,
      from a packaging perspective all languages that run on Beam are
      interchangable. The things that do change, like the build
      system, are transperant to the users of the package. So we make
      no distinction.

    <title>Rebar3</title>
    <para>
      By default Rebar3 wants to manage it's own dependencies. In the
      normal non-Nix, this is perfectly acceptable. In the Nix world it
      is not. To support this we have created two versions of rebar3,
      <literal>rebar3</literal> and <literal>rebar3-open</literal>. The
      <literal>rebar3</literal> version has been patched to remove the
      ability to download anything from it. If you are not running it a
      nix-shell or a nix-build then its probably not going to work for
      you. <literal>rebar3-open</literal> is the normal, un-modified
      rebar3. It should work exactly as would any other version of
      rebar3. Any Erlang package should rely on
      <literal>rebar3</literal> and thats really what you should be
      using too.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="build-tools-other">
    <title>Mix &amp; Erlang.mk</title>
    <para>
      Both Mix and Erlang.mk work exactly as you would expect. There
      is a bootstrap process that needs to be run for both of
      them. However, that is supported by the
      <literal>buildMix</literal> and <literal>buildErlangMk</literal> derivations.

  <title>How to install Beam packages</title>
  <para>
    Beam packages are not registered in the top level simply because
    they are not relevant to the vast majority of Nix users. They are
    installable using the <literal>beamPackages</literal> attribute
    set.

    You can list the avialable packages in the
    <literal>beamPackages</literal> with the following command:
  </para>

  <programlisting>
$ nix-env -f &quot;&lt;nixpkgs&gt;&quot; -qaP -A beamPackages
beamPackages.esqlite    esqlite-0.2.1
beamPackages.goldrush   goldrush-0.1.7
beamPackages.ibrowse    ibrowse-4.2.2
beamPackages.jiffy      jiffy-0.14.5
beamPackages.lager      lager-3.0.2
beamPackages.meck       meck-0.8.3
beamPackages.rebar3-pc  pc-1.1.0
  </programlisting>
  <para>
    To install any of those packages into your profile, refer to them by
    their attribute path (first column):
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ nix-env -f &quot;&lt;nixpkgs&gt;&quot; -iA beamPackages.ibrowse
  </programlisting>
  <para>
    The attribute path of any Beam packages corresponds to the name
    of that particular package in Hex or its OTP Application/Release name.

      <para>
        There is a Nix functional called
        <literal>buildRebar3</literal>. We use this function to make a
        derivation that understands how to build the rebar3 project. For
        example, the epression we use to build the <link
        xlink:href="https://github.com/erlang-nix/hex2nix">hex2nix</link>
        project follows.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
        {stdenv, fetchFromGitHub, buildRebar3, ibrowse, jsx, erlware_commons }:

          buildRebar3 rec {

      <para>
        The only visible difference between this derivation and
        something like <literal>stdenv.mkDerivation</literal> is that we
        have added <literal>erlangDeps</literal> to the derivation. If
        you add your Beam dependencies here they will be correctly
        handled by the system.
      </para>

    Updating the Hex packages requires the use of the
    <literal>hex2nix</literal> tool. Given the path to the Erlang
    modules (usually
    <literal>pkgs/development/erlang-modules</literal>). It will
    happily dump a file called

    the packages that use a recognized build system in Hex. However,
    it can't know whether or not all those packages are buildable.
    </para>
    <para>
      To make life easier for our users, it makes good sense to go
      ahead and attempt to build all those packages and remove the
      ones that don't build. To do that, simply run the command (in
      the root of your <literal>nixpkgs</literal> repository). that follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ nix-build -A beamPackages
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      That will build every package in
      <literal>beamPackages</literal>. Then you can go through and

      that.
