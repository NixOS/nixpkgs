 <title>Coq</title>

 <para>
  Coq libraries should be installed in
  <literal>$(out)/lib/coq/${coq.coq-version}/user-contrib/</literal>. Such
  directories are automatically added to the <literal>$COQPATH</literal>
  environment variable by the hook defined in the Coq derivation.
 </para>

 <para>
  Some libraries require OCaml and sometimes also Camlp5 or findlib. The exact
  versions that were used to build Coq are saved in the
  <literal>coq.ocaml</literal> and <literal>coq.camlp5</literal> and
  <literal>coq.findlib</literal> attributes.
 </para>

 <para>
  Coq libraries may be compatible with some specific versions of Coq only. The
  <literal>compatibleCoqVersions</literal> attribute is used to precisely
  select those versions of Coq that are compatible with this derivation.
 </para>

 <para>
  Here is a simple package example. It is a pure Coq library, thus it depends
  on Coq. It builds on the Mathematical Components library, thus it also takes
  <literal>mathcomp</literal> as <literal>buildInputs</literal>. Its
  <literal>Makefile</literal> has been generated using
  <literal>coq_makefile</literal> so we only have to set the
  <literal>$COQLIB</literal> variable at install time.
