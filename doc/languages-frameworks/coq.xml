<title>Coq</title>
  <para>
    Coq libraries should be installed in
    <literal>$(out)/lib/coq/${coq.coq-version}/user-contrib/</literal>.
    Such directories are automatically added to the
    <literal>$COQPATH</literal> environment variable by the hook defined
    in the Coq derivation.
  </para>
  <para>
    Some libraries require OCaml and sometimes also Camlp5 or findlib.
    The exact versions that were used to build Coq are saved in the
    <literal>coq.ocaml</literal> and <literal>coq.camlp5</literal>
    and <literal>coq.findlib</literal> attributes.
  </para>
  <para>
    Coq libraries may be compatible with some specific versions of Coq only.
    The <literal>compatibleCoqVersions</literal> attribute is used to
    precisely select those versions of Coq that are compatible with this
    derivation.
  </para>
  <para>
    Here is a simple package example. It is a pure Coq library, thus it
    depends on Coq. It builds on the Mathematical Components library, thus it
    also takes <literal>mathcomp</literal> as <literal>buildInputs</literal>.
    Its <literal>Makefile</literal> has been generated using
    <literal>coq_makefile</literal> so we only have to
    set the <literal>$COQLIB</literal> variable at install time.
