The [[#chap-stdenv][standard build environment]] makes it easy to build
typical Autotools-based packages with very little code. Any other kind
of package can be accomodated by overriding the appropriate phases of
=stdenv=. However, there are specialised functions in Nixpkgs to easily
build packages for other programming languages, such as Perl or Haskell.
These are described in this chapter.
