# Autoconf {#setup-hook-autoconf}

The `autoreconfHook` derivation adds `autoreconfPhase`, which runs autoreconf, libtoolize and automake, essentially preparing the configure script in autotools-based builds. Most autotools-based packages come with the configure script pre-generated, but this hook is necessary for a few packages and when you need to patch the packageâ€™s configure scripts.
