### scons {#scons}
>>>>>>> 903308adb4b (Improved error handling, differentiate nix/non-nix networks)

Overrides the build, install, and check phases. This uses the scons build system as a replacement for make. scons does not provide a configure phase, so everything is managed at build and install time.
