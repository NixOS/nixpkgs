# Sets the ofborg-eval status to "pending" to signal that we are waiting for
# OfBorg even if it is running late. The status will be overwritten by OfBorg
# once it starts evaluation.

# WARNING:
# When extending this action, be aware that $GITHUB_TOKEN allows (restricted) write access to
# the GitHub repository. This means that it should not evaluate user input in a
# way that allows code injection.
