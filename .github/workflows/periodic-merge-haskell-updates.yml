# This action periodically merges a merge base of master and staging into haskell-updates.
#
# haskell-updates is based on master (so there are little unrelated failures and the cache
# is already prepopulated), but needs to target staging due to the high amount of rebuilds
# it typically causes. To prevent unrelated commits clattering the GitHub UI, we need to
# take care to only merge the merge-base of master and staging into haskell-updates.
#
