# Some workflows depend on the base branch of the PR, but changing the base branch is not included in the default trigger events, which would be `opened`, `synchronize` or `reopened`.
# Instead it causes an `edited` event.
# Since `edited` is also triggered when PR title/body is changed, we use this wrapper workflow, to run the other workflows conditionally only.
# There are already feature requests for adding a `base_changed` event:
# - https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/35058
# - https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/64119
#
# Instead of adding this to each workflow's pull_request_target event, we trigger this in a separate workflow.
# This has the advantage, that we can actually skip running those jobs for simple edits like changing the title or description.
# The actual trigger happens by closing and re-opening the pull request, which triggers the default pull_request_target events.
# This is much simpler and reliable than other approaches.
