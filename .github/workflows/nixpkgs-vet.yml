# `nixpkgs-vet` is a tool to vet Nixpkgs: its architecture, package structure, and more.
# Among other checks, it makes sure that `pkgs/by-name` (see `../../pkgs/by-name/README.md`) follows the validity rules outlined in [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140).
# When you make changes to this workflow, please also update `ci/nixpkgs-vet.sh` to reflect the impact of your work to the CI.
# See https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-vet for details on the tool and its checks.
