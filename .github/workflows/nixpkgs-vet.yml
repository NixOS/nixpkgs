# `nixpkgs-vet` is a tool to vet Nixpkgs: its architecture, package structure, and more.
# Among other checks, it makes sure that `pkgs/by-name` (see `../../pkgs/by-name/README.md`) follows the validity rules outlined in [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140).
# When you make changes to this workflow, please also update `ci/nixpkgs-vet.sh` to reflect the impact of your work to the CI.
# See https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-vet for details on the tool and its checks.

  pull_request_target:
    # This workflow depends on the base branch of the PR, but changing the base branch is not included in the default trigger events, which would be `opened`, `synchronize` or `reopened`.
    # Instead it causes an `edited` event, so we need to add it explicitly here.
    # While `edited` is also triggered when the PR title/body is changed, this PR action is fairly quick, and PRs don't get edited **that** often, so it shouldn't be a problem.
    # There is a feature request for adding a `base_changed` event: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/35058

# We don't use a concurrency group here, because the action is triggered quite often (due to the PR edit trigger), and contributors would get notified on any canceled run.
# There is a feature request for suppressing notifications on concurrency-canceled runs: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/13015
