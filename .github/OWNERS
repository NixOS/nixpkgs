####################
#
# This file is used to describe who owns what in this repository.
# Users/teams will get review requests for PRs that change their files.
#
# This file does not replace `meta.maintainers`
# but is instead used for other things than derivations and modules,
# like documentation, package sets, and other assets.
#
# This file uses the same syntax as the natively supported CODEOWNERS file,
# see https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/ for documentation.
# However it comes with some notable differences:
# - There is no need for user/team listed here to have write access.
# - No reviews will be requested for PRs that target the wrong base branch.
#
# Processing of this file is implemented in workflows/codeowners.yml
