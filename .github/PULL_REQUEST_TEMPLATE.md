<!-- Nixpkgs has a lot of new incoming Pull Requests, but not enough people to review this constant stream. Even if you aren't a committer, we would appreciate reviews of other PRs, especially simple ones like package updates. Just testing the relevant package/service and leaving a comment saying what you tested, how you tested it and whether it worked would be great. List of open PRs: <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls>, for more about reviewing contributions: <https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixpkgs/trunk/manual/latest/download/1/nixpkgs/manual.html#chap-reviewing-contributions>. Reviewing isn't mandatory, but it would help out a lot and reduce the average time-to-merge for all of us. Thanks a lot if you do! -->
