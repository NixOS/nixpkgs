# This file defines the ignore rules for zizmor.
#
# For rules that contain a high number of false positives, prefer listing them here
# instead of adding ignore comments. Note that zizmor cannot ignore by line-within-a-string, so
# there are some ignore items that encompass multiple problems within one `run` block. An issue
# tracking this is at https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor/issues/648.
#
# For more info, see the documentation: https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/usage/#ignoring-results
