  Thank you for your contributions.

  This has been automatically marked as stale because it has had no
  activity for 180 days.

  If this is still important to you, we ask that you leave a
  comment below. Your comment can be as simple as "still important
  to me". This lets people see that at least one person still cares
  about this. Someone will have to do this at most twice a year if
  there is no other activity.

  Here are suggestions that might help resolve this more quickly:

  1. Search for maintainers and people that previously touched the
     related code and @ mention them in a comment.
  2. Ask on the [NixOS Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/).
  3. Ask on the [#nixos channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/#nixos) on
     [irc.freenode.net](https://freenode.net).
