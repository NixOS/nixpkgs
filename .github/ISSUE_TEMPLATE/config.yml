  - name: Package Request
    url: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-create-pull-requests
    about: |
      Package requests were removed, as maintainers should generally try to package stuff
      that they use. There's an increased risk of breakage being unnoticed over time, and
      a broken package is often worse than no package. Since the notability requirement
      for a project to be accepted into nixpkgs is trivial (there should be a potential
      userbase of at least 5, and for libraries, there must be at least one dependency),
      there is no longer any reason to accept package requests. You should instead try to
      package it yourself. It'll take a few hours to learn how to do it, but if you like
      NixOS, it's worth it. See the following resource to get familiar with the process:

      https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-create-pull-requests

      Then, reference the language-specific document in the `doc/languages-frameworks`
      directory for next steps, or view the rendered manual:

      See https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/391926 for the discussion surrounding
      this decision.
