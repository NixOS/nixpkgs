        Welcome to Nixpkgs. Please replace the **`nixos/MODULENAME: BUG TITLE`** template above with the correct module name (As seen in the [NixOS Option Search](https://search.nixos.org/options)) and a short title summarising what the bug entails.

        > [!TIP]
        > For instance, if you were filing a bug against the [`systemd-boot`](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&show=boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable&from=0&size=1) module about it failing to install [`memtest86`](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&show=boot.loader.systemd-boot.memtest86.enable&from=0&size=1), your title would be as follows:
        > ```
        > nixos/systemd-boot: fails to install memtest86
        > ```

        Please mention the people who are in the `meta.maintainers` list of the offending module. This is done by prefixing the person's username with an '@' character. You can quickly go to the source code of a module by searching for it on the [NixOS Option Search](https://search.nixos.org/options) and clicking the "Declared in..." button.

        Please note that the maintainer attribute name does not always match the maintainer's GitHub username. If that occurs, try looking in [`maintainers/maintainer-list.nix`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/maintainers/maintainer-list.nix) for the maintainer attribute name, and checking if the maintainer has a listed GitHub username.

        If in doubt, check the associated package's maintainers. Please add the mentions above the `---` characters.
