        Welcome to Nixpkgs. Please replace the **`Module Request: nixos/MODULENAME`** template above with the correct module name (As seen in the [NixOS Option Search](https://search.nixos.org/options)).

        > [!TIP]
        > For instance, if you were filing a request against the missing `hello` module, your title would be as follows:
        > ```
        > Module Request: nixos/hello
        > ```
