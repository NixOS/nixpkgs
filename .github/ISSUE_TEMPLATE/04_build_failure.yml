        Welcome to Nixpkgs. Please replace the **`Build failure: PACKAGENAME`** template above with the correct package name (As seen in the [NixOS Package Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages)).

        > [!TIP]
        > For instance, if you were filing a build failure against the [`hello`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=1&buckets=%7B%22package_attr_set%22%3A%5B%22No%20package%20set%22%5D%2C%22package_license_set%22%3A%5B%22GNU%20General%20Public%20License%20v3.0%20or%20later%22%5D%2C%22package_maintainers_set%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22package_platforms%22%3A%5B%5D%7D&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=hello) package, your title would be as follows:
        > ```
        > Build failure: hello
        > ```

        In what version of Nixpkgs did the build failure occur?

        If you are using an older version, please update to the latest stable version and check if the build failure persists before continuing this report.

        If you are purposefully trying to build an ancient version of a package in an older Nixpkgs, please coordinate with the [NixOS Archivists](https://matrix.to/#/#archivists:nixos.org).

        Can [Hydra](https://hydra.nixos.org), Nixpkgs' Continuous Integration system, reproduce this build failure?
        Please use the search function in the header bar to locate the last build job for the package in question.
        - If there's a <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NixOS/hydra/refs/heads/master/src/root/static/images/emojione-red-x-274c.svg" width="20px" align="top" alt="Red X"> icon near the package entry, say '**Yes, Hydra can reproduce this build failure.**'
        - If there's a <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NixOS/hydra/refs/heads/master/src/root/static/images/emojione-gray-x-2716.svg" width="20px" align="top" alt="Dark Gray X"> icon near the package entry, then the build failure occurs with another package, and you need to track the original failing package by going down the chain of 'Cached failures' until you reach the final package in the failing dependency chain. Once you locate the failing package, re-write this report against that package and say '**Yes, Hydra can reproduce this build failure.**'
        - If there's a <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NixOS/hydra/refs/heads/master/src/root/static/images/emojione-check-2714.svg" width="20px" align="top" alt="Green Check Mark"> icon near the package entry, then it most likely means it's a local issue with your system. (Maybe you ran out of space?)
          You can still open a build failure report, but please say '**No, Hydra cannot reproduce this build failure.**' below.
        - If there's a <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NixOS/hydra/refs/heads/master/src/root/static/images/emojione-question-2754.svg" width="20px" align="top" alt="Gray Question Mark"> icon near the package entry, say '**Hydra is currently rebuilding this package.**'

If this occurs, please coordinate with the [Infrastructure Team](https://matrix.to/#/#infra:nixos.org), and say '**The last build job was manually cancelled.**'
        - If Hydra isn't supposed to build the package at all, say '**Hydra doesn’t try to build the package.**'
      options:
        - "Please select the Hydra Status."

Please add the mentions above the `---` characters in the template below.
