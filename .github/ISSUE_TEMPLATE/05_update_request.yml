        Welcome to Nixpkgs. Please replace the **`Update Request: PACKAGENAME OLDVERSION → NEWVERSION`** template above with the correct package name (As seen in the [NixOS Package Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages)), the current version of the package, and the latest version of the package.

        > [!TIP]
        > For instance, if you were filing a request against the out of date `hello` package, where the current version in Nixpkgs is 1.0.0, but the latest version upstream is 1.0.1, your title would be as follows:
        > ```
        > Update Request: hello 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
        > ```
