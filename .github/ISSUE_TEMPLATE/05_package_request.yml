        Welcome to Nixpkgs. Please replace the **`Package request: PACKAGENAME`** template above with the correct package name (As seen in the [NixOS Package Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages)).

        > [!TIP]
        > For instance, if you were filing a request against the missing `hello` package, your title would be as follows:
        > `Package request: hello`
