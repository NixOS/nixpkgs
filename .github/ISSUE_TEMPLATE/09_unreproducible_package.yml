        Welcome to Nixpkgs. Please replace the **`Unreproducible Package: PACKAGENAME`** template above with the correct package name (As seen in the [NixOS Package Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages)).

        > [!NOTE]
        > This form is for reporting unreproducible packages. For more information, see the [Reproducible Builds Status](https://reproducible.nixos.org/) page.
        >
        > To report a package that fails to build entirely, please use the "Build Failure" form instead.

        This is a generic introduction to build reproducibility.
        Please replace **PACKAGENAME** below with the canonical package name of the package, as you have done for the title above.
      value: |
        Building **PACKAGENAME** multiple times does not yield bit-by-bit identical
        results, complicating the detection of Continuous Integration (CI) breaches. For
        more information on this issue, visit [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

        Fixing bit-by-bit reproducibility also has additional advantages, such as
        avoiding hard-to-reproduce bugs, making content-addressed storage more effective
        and reducing rebuilds in such systems.

        This is a step-by-step instruction set meant for maintainers to debug the package that is failing to reproduce. You should also follow it to gather the `diffoscope` logs that will be needed below.
        Please replace **PACKAGENAME** below with the canonical package name of the package, as you have done for the introduction and the title above.

        ### 1. Build the package

        This step will build the package. Specific arguments are passed to the command
        to keep the build artifacts so we can compare them in case of differences.

        Execute the following command:

        ```
        nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A PACKAGENAME && nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A PACKAGENAME --check --keep-failed
        ```

        Or using the new command line style:

        ```
        nix build nixpkgs#PACKAGENAME && nix build nixpkgs#PACKAGENAME --rebuild --keep-failed
        ```

        ### 2. Compare the build artifacts

        If the previous command completes successfully, no differences were found and
        there's nothing to do, builds are reproducible.
        If it terminates with the error message `error: derivation '<X>' may not be
        deterministic: output '<Y>' differs from '<Z>'`, use `diffoscope` to investigate
        the discrepancies between the two build outputs. You may need to add the
        `--exclude-directory-metadata recursive` option to ignore files and directories
        metadata (*e.g. timestamp*) differences.

        ```
        nix run nixpkgs#diffoscopeMinimal -- --exclude-directory-metadata recursive <Y> <Z>
        ```

        ### 3. Examine the build log

        To examine the build log, use:

        ```
        nix-store --read-log $(nix-instantiate '<nixpkgs>' -A PACKAGENAME)
        ```

        Or with the new command line style:

        ```
        nix log $(nix path-info --derivation nixpkgs#PACKAGENAME)
        ```

        Please mention the people who are in the **Maintainers** list of the offending package. This is done by by searching for the package on the [NixOS Package Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages) and mentioning the people listed under **Maintainers** by prefixing their GitHub usernames with an '@' character. Please add the mentions above the `---` characters in the template below.
