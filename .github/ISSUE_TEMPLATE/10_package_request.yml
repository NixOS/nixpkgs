        Thank you for your interest in packaging new software in Nixpkgs. Unfortunately, to mitigate the unsustainable growth of unmaintained packages, **Nixpkgs is no longer accepting package requests** via Issues.

        As a [volunteer community][community], we are always open to new contributors. If you wish to see this package in Nixpkgs, **we encourage you to [contribute] it yourself**, via a Pull Request. Anyone can [become a package maintainer][maintainers]! You can find language-specific packaging information in the [Nixpkgs Manual][nixpkgs]. Should you need any help, please reach out to the community on [Matrix] or [Discourse].
