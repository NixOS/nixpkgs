## Announcements

* _Welcome to Botnix!_
* We are working on our first major release: `Botnix 1.0 TorbjÃ¶rn` (pronounced *torr-beyourn*, meaning "Bear of Thor") &#128059;
* `Botnix` works out-of-the-box using standard `NixOS` conventions and is currently in active development.
* Join us in building the future of robot operating systems! See the [Contributing](#contributing) section. We welcome contributions from all.

## Vision

> "The first era of operating systems (OSes) was defined by the punchcard, while the second, third, and fourth were defined by the keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen, respectively. With Botnix, we begin a fifth era defined by artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive programs for powerful and diverse user and computer interaction. The rise of the hybrid computer architecuture and modern compiler infrastructure together provide the ideal foundation to forge a new era of the AI-OS." [-Dr. Adam Erickson, 2024](#)

## Introduction

`Botnix` is the first operating system (OS) and Linux distribution for multi-agent and -domain *autonomous systems*, *intelligent robotic systems*, or [*embodiment*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04918) as it is known in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community. `Botnix` stands for "Robot Linux" or "Robotics Linux". **Our goal is to create the ideal OS for intelligent robotic systems in-the-wild**, built on the widely deployed and field-tested Linux kernel and the powerful Nix [software deployment model](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf). `Botnix` provides the `Botpkgs` or "Bot packages" software repository, a domain-specific subset of the 80,000+ packages found in the [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/) repository. `Botnix` is a single-purpose, battle-hardened variant of `NixOS` using the same declarative design. It is a production-grade OS that supports state-of-the-art research in AI for robotics.

`Botnix` is designed with the future in mind. As a community of [Builders](https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/), we aim to accelerate the development and deployment of AI for robotics. The `Botnix` software and community are free and open-source. We welcome contributions from all individuals, organizations, and industries. *We are grateful for your support!*

## Getting Started

Coming soon.

### Operational Modes

The `Botnix` OS will be available in seven different flavors or operational modes:

1. Agent
2. Orchestrator
3. Knowledgebase (or vector database)
4. Monitor
5. Simulator (via [AutonomySim](https://github.com/nervosys/AutonomySim))
6. Trainer
7. Developer

Each of the modes involves specialized configurations that reflect their use cases within the realm of autonomous systems.

At present, we are focusing on the `Agent` mode.

## Documentation

Below you can find documentation for Robotics Linux (`Botnix`), Robotics Packages (`Botpkgs`), and `AutonomySim` from [Nervosys](https://nervosys.ai/), as well as related [NixOS Foundation](https://nixos.org/community/index.html) projects.

### Botnix and Botpkgs

* [Botnix and Botpkgs Manual](https://nervosys.github.io/Botnix/) - The operating system for autonomous systems

### AutonomySim

`Botnix` is only half of the equation in developing and deploying autonomous systems for the real world. `Botnix` is designed to be co-developed and integrated with [`AutonomySim`](https://github.com/nervosys/AutonomySim/), the simulation engine for autonomous systems, for which documentation can be found below.

* [AutonomySim](https://nervosys.github.io/AutonomySim/) - The simulation engine for autonomous systems

### NixOS, Nixpkgs, Nix

* [NixOS Manual](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/) - how to install, configure, and maintain a purely-functional Linux distribution
* [Nixpkgs Manual](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/) - contributing to Nixpkgs and using programming-language-specific Nix expressions
* [Nix Manual](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/) - how to write Nix expressions (programs), and how to use Nix command line tools

## Why Botnix?

Like many of you, we are thrilled about recent advances in open-source AI and robotics, but have run across some challenges along the way:

1. The [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) is not an OS at all, but rather, a collection of software packages. Getting ROS installed and configured for a particular OS can be a hassle. This increases the time needed to get up and running. ROS also provides no little to no tools to manage robot sofware deployment, requiring third-party tools with additional complexity and constraints.
2. [RoboStack](https://robostack.github.io/) is a step in the right direction by using the Conda package manager for dependency management in C/C++ and Python projects. Unfortunately, it is an incomplete solution that introduces yet another package manager to be managed.
3. Configuring a machine for AI development and/or deployment can still be a significant burden. Common challenges include installing mutually compatible graphics drivers, CUDA libraries, and deep learning frameworks. An entirely separate package manager such as [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is often used for dependecy management. If we begin with the 'right' package manager (e.g., `Nix`), all of this added complexity becomes unnecessary.
4. Popular flight control system (FCS) software (e.g., ArduPilot, PX4, BetaFlight) projects remain focused on microcontroller-based real-time OSes for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). ArduPilot and PX4 are based on [ChibiOS](https://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php) and Apache [NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/), respectively, two hard real-time OSes designed for microcontrollers. Because of this, ArduPilot- and PX4-based systems still must rely on separate Linux companion computers for the heavy lifting. *This is not the way*.
5. [ROS-O](https://github.com/ros-o/ros-o/), or `ROS One`, aims to make it easier to deploy `ROS` by providing patches for popular operating systems and package managers. `ROS-O` is not an operating system and is limited to ROS deployment, making it a piecemeal solution.
6. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 12 ("bookworm") is our favorite release to date, but it remains a traditional Linux OS poorly suited to our use case.
7. While [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/robotics/) is the most popular Linux OS, and Ubuntu Core is intended for robotics among other things, it has all of the limitations of Debian plus proprietary Snaps, a closed source, and a high price. *Robotics should be open to everyone*.
8. [The Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and the related [OpenEmbedded layers for ROS](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros) is a major step in the right direction, but OSes must be hand-crafted and lack the powerful Nix system for configuring and deploying robotic systems, which we call RoboDevSecOps.
9. [OSTree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/) is yet another solution designed without robotics in mind that must be arduously adapted to our use case.
10. [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) is the next best thing to `NixOS` with some theoretical advantages. In practice though, we found `Guix` to be less reliable and supported than `NixOS`. While the potential there, we were more comfortable moving forward with the large and rapidly growing `Nix` community.
11. We love unikernels or Library operating systems (libOSes), but they are often slow and painful to deploy using common tools. Thankfully `Nix` can automate the process. That's right, you can use `Nix` to [build and deploy unikernels](https://tarides.com/blog/2022-12-14-hillingar-mirageos-unikernels-on-nixos/). The two systems are not mutually exclusive.

After careful consideration, we decided that the focus of `Botnix` substantially differs from that of `NixOS` and other communities, given our sole focus on AI for robotics. There are numerous drivers and applications that are relevant to a general-purpose OS, but not to our use case. Removing this overhead allows us to be more efficient. We want to accelerate robotics, and to do so, we must be focused.

Last, we felt that the Apache 2.0 license might be better suited to commercial adoption.

## Background

While compute and energy constraints have historically limited robotic systems to legacy real-time OSes running on underpowered microcontrollers, these constraints are rapidly vanishing with development of new low-power [processor architectures](https://riscv.org/), [domain-specific accelerators](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3350755.3400252), [unified memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12149), and [high-speed interconnects](https://www.uciexpress.org/), as demonstrated by the [NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/), [Apple M1 system-on-chip (SoC)](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-unleashes-m1/), and [AMD chiplet technology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499852). This revolution in computing is powering a new Age of Embodied Intelligence. *We aim to be the operating system (OS) of the robotics revolution*.

**Embodied AI**: `Botnix` is intended to be the first OS with native, batteries-included support for robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) at both the high- and low-level. We aim to bring the robotics and AI software ecosystems out of piecemeal, standalone packages and libraries and into a cohesive whole at the OS level. This includes boilerplate interfaces necessary to communicate between popular software systems used in different robotics domains. We further aim to provide tools for physical intuition, such as real-time internal physics engines for hybrid neurosymbolic AI inference.

**RoboDevSecOps**: `Botnix` aims to be the ideal OS for AI and robotics developer-security-operations or [RoboDevSecOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devsecops/), as the safety of deployed systems is a primary consideration in AI and robotics alike. More than a package manager, the powerful [Nix system](https://nixos.org/) enables us to provide a simple, declarative, stateful, reproducible OS with native depedency isolation (think of it as built-in containers), cloud over-the-air (OTA) updates, and rollbacks. We aim to buttress this system with robust kernel-hardening, penetration testing, monitoring, and CVE notification systems.

**Inclusive Community**: Any open-source project is only as good as its community. To make our shared vision a reality, we are creating a new community of talented contributors. We strive to create a community where all individuals, organizations, and viewpoints are welcome. We default to protecting your rights.
