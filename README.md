# SigmaSquadron's Nixpkgs Fork

Welcome! This nixpkgs fork is where I stage my public contributions to upstream [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs). I'm currently working on packaging the Xen Hypervisor; check the branches for sources. Everything is targeting the master branch in upstream nixpkgs.

Please avoid opening issues or PRs here; report them to upstream [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) instead. I only use GitHub for upstream contributions, so I might not see your comments to this repository.
