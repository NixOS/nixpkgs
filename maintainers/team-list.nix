  where

  - `members` is the list of maintainers belonging to the group,
  - `scope` describes the scope of the group.
  - `shortName` short human-readable name
  - `enableFeatureFreezePing` will ping this team during the Feature Freeze announcements on releases
    - There is limited mention capacity in a single post, so this should be reserved for critical components
      or larger ecosystems within nixpkgs.
  - `github` will ping the specified GitHub team as well

  More fields may be added in the future.
