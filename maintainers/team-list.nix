  where

  - `members` is the list of maintainers belonging to the group,
  - `scope` describes the scope of the group.
  - `shortName` short human-readable name
  - `enableFeatureFreezePing` will ping this team during the Feature Freeze announcements on releases
    - There is limited mention capacity in a single post, so this should be reserved for critical components
      or larger ecosystems within nixpkgs.
  - `github` will ping the specified GitHub team and sync the `members`, `scope` and `shortName` fields from it
  - `githubId` will be set automatically based on `github`

  If `github` is specified and you'd like to be added to the team, contact one of the `githubMaintainers` of the team:

      nix eval -f lib teams.someTeam.githubMaintainers --json | jq

  More fields may be added in the future.
