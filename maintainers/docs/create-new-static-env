Creating a new static stdenv
----------------------------

When Nix is ported to a new (Linux) platform and you want to have a completely
pure setup for the stdenv (for example for NixOS) it is necessary to rebuild
the static tools.

The challenge is that there is no Nix environment yet, for bootstrapping.
The first task is to create all the tools that are necessary. For most tools
there are ready made Nix expressions.


  GCC

There is an expression gcc-static-3.4. Depending on whether or not you already
have an environment built with Nix (x86-linux: yes, rest: not yet) you should
set the noSysDirs parameter in all-packages.nix. If there is an environment,
leave it, but if the system is still impure (like most systems), set noSysDirs
to false.
