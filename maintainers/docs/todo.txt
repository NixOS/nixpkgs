* Patch development/tools/misc/libtool not to search standard
  directories for libraries (like setup.sh does now). [do we want
  this?]

* In setup.sh: add configureFlagsArray or something

* Inform freedesktop people that Xaw requires Xpm.

* After building gcc, filter out references to /tmp/nix... in
  .../lib/libsupc++.la and .../lib/libstdc++.la

* Add gettext to glib propagatedBuildInputs?  Glib's `gi18n.h' doesn't
  seem to like Glibc `libintl.h'; needs the gettext one instead.
  [Move from libbonoboui]

* Fix the bzip2 build generically.

* In stdenv/setup.sh: put the call to patchelf etc. in a separate
  phase (fixupPhase?) that comes after the installPhase.  This is so
  that when one overrides installPhase, the fixup stuff is still done.
