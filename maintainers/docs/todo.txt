* Patch development/tools/misc/libtool not to search standard
  directories for libraries (like setup.sh does now). [do we want
  this?]

* Inform freedesktop people that Xaw requires Xpm.

* After building gcc, filter out references to /tmp/nix... in
  .../lib/libsupc++.la and .../lib/libstdc++.la

* Add gettext to glib propagatedBuildInputs?  Glib's `gi18n.h' doesn't
  seem to like Glibc `libintl.h'; needs the gettext one instead.
  [Move from libbonoboui]
