This patch is to make sure that `libncurses' is among the `NEEDED'
dependencies of `libreadline.so' and `libhistory.so'.

Failing to do that, applications linking against Readline are
forced to explicitly link against libncurses as well; in addition,
this trick doesn't work when using GNU ld's `--as-needed'.
