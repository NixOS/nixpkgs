Subject: Update SVMlight scrubber script

This requires previously fixing a few wrong preprocessor directives that
are supposed to fence code using SVMlight.

- The script was too eager and removing *.light files in SVMlight format
  that are used by other tests. The code reading those files doesn't use
  any SVMlight code so it should be fine to keep it and run the tests.

- The Python test *domainadaptationsvm.py was not removed because of
  wrong globbing.

- Remove a couple of examples using SVMlight that were missed.

- The script is actually modifying (and breaking) itself because the
  grep for the USE_SVMLIGHT macro is too eager again and matches itself
  (and the version stored in upstream's Debian package control tarball
  is broken because of it). Just fix it by grepping for preprocessor
  directives only.

- No need to fix the Transfer_includes.i file in the script with a final
  %} when its preprocessor directives have been fixed.

- The Swig files were moved to a new directory at some point but the
  script was not updated accordingly.
