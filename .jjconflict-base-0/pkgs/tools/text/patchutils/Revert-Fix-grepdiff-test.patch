Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Fix grepdiff test"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This reverts commit a6538753a51db973a05c9034ed78f2dd946453db.

There's no need for an escape here, because POSIX regexes don't treat
'+' specially if it's at the start of the experssion.  musl rejects
the version with the backslash.

I'm still not clear why this change was made in the first place, but
reverting it seems to make the test pass on both glibc and muslâ€¦
