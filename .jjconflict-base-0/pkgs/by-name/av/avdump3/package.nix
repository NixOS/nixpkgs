    longDescription = ''
      AVDump is a tool to extract meta information from media files while at the
      same time calculating multiple hashes. Based on that information reports
      can be generated in multiple forms. Of particular interest is the ability
      to send those reports back to AniDB and thereby quickly filling in missing
      metadata for new files.
