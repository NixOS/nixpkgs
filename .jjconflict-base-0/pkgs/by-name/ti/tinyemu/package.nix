      TinyEMU is a system emulator for the RISC-V and x86 architectures. Its
      purpose is to be small and simple while being complete.

      Main features:

      - RISC-V system emulator supporting the RV128IMAFDQC base ISA (user level
        ISA version 2.2, priviledged architecture version 1.10) including:
        - 32/64/128 bit integer registers
        - 32/64/128 bit floating point instructions (using the SoftFP Library)
        - Compressed instructions
        - Dynamic XLEN change
      - x86 system emulator based on KVM
      - VirtIO console, network, block device, input and 9P filesystem
      - Graphical display with SDL
      - JSON configuration file
      - Remote HTTP block device and filesystem
      - Small code, easy to modify, few external dependancies
      - Javascript version running Linux and Windows 2000.
