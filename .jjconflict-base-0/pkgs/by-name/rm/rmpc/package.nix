      Rusty Music Player Client is a beautiful, modern and configurable terminal-based Music Player
      Daemon client. It was inspired by ncmpcpp and aims to provide an alternative with support for
      album art through kitty image protocol without any ugly hacks. It also features ranger/lf
      inspired browsing of songs and other goodies.
