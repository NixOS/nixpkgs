      Created to allow displaying dynamic wallpapers based on the specification format used for example in the `Gnome` desktop environment.
      It is designed to offer a _smooth_ transition between wallpapers and gradual change over long and short periods of time.
      For a fast handling `enkei` uses `OpenGL` to render images and blending them for transitions.
